Which elements of specific artworks do they focus on? Do museum labels have an impact on how people look at artworks? The viewing experience of art is a complex one, involving issues of perception, attention, memory, decision-making, affect, and emotion. Thus, the time it takes and the ways of visually exploring an artwork can inform about its relevance, interestingness, and even its aesthetic appeal. This paper describes a collaborative pilot project focusing on a unique collection of 17th Century Zurbar\u00e1n paintings. The Jacob cycle at Auckland Castle is the only UK example of a continental collection preserved in situ in purpose-built surroundings. While studies of the psychology of art have focused on individual works and distinctions between representative / non-representative topics, no work has been completed on the aesthetic appreciation of collections or of devotional themes. In this paper, we report upon the novel insights eye-tracking techniques have provided into the unconscious processes of viewing the unique collection of Zurbar\u00e1n artworks. The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the effects of different written interpretation on the visual exploration of artworks. We will discuss the potential implications of these techniques and our understanding of visual behaviours on museum and gallery practice. The project brings together established research strengths in Spanish art history, experimental psychology, digital humanities, and museum studies to explore, using eye-tracking techniques, aesthetic reactions to digital representations of the individual Zurbar\u00e1n artworks as well as the significance of the collection as a whole. Our experience of art develops from the interaction of several cognitive and affective processes; the beginning of which is a visual scan of the artwork. When regarding an artwork, a viewer gathers information through a series fixations, interspersed by rapid movements of the eye called saccades. The direction of saccades is determined by an interaction between the goals of the observer and the physical properties of the different elements of the scene (e.g. colour, texture, brightness etc). Importantly, studying eye movements offers an insight that does not depend on the participants\u2019 beliefs, memories or subjective impressions of the artwork. Previous eye tracking research has highlighted the potential to transform the ways we understand visual processing in the arts (see for example Brieber 2014; Binderman et al., 2005) and at the same time offers a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit (Filippini Fantoni et al., 2013; Heidenreich & Turano 2011; Milekic 2010). Zurbar\u00e1n\u2019s cycle of Jacob and his Sons has been on display in the Long Room at Auckland Castle for over 250 years. It is the only cycle to be preserved in purpose-built surroundings in the UK, and one of very few of its kind in the world. It has a long history in scholarship (Baron & Beresford 2014), but many key aspects of its production and significance have not yet been fully understood. In this study we used eye-tracking in the first stage of exploring audience experience of the extensive Spanish art collections of County Durham, of which the 13 Zurbar\u00e1n artworks (there are actually only 12 Zurbar\u00e1n artworks, the 13th Benjamin, is a copy by Arthur Pond) are a key part of, to investigate the ways in which audiences look at Spanish art, how aesthetic experience is evaluated and whether audiences can be encouraged to approach art in different ways. This pilot project primarily investigated how participants visually explore artworks and provides new insights into the potential eye-tracking has to transform the ways we understand visual processing in arts and culture and at the same time offer a direct way of studying several important factors of a museum visit, namely to assess the effects of label characteristics on visitor visual behaviour.", "human1": "This paper presents an eye tracking study to explore how viewers experience art, focusing on a 17th Century collection of Spanish paintings by Zurbar\u00e1n."}, "GUM_academic_census": {"fulltext": "1 Introduction Tenured and tenure-track university faculty play a special role in determining the speed and direction of scientific progress, both directly through their research and indirectly through their training of new researchers. Past studies establish that each of these efforts is strongly and positively influenced through various forms of faculty diversity, including ethnic, racial, and gender diversity. As an example, research shows that greater diversity within a community or group can lead to improved critical thinking [1] and more creative solutions to complex tasks [2, 3] by pairing together individuals with unique skillsets and perspectives that complement and often augment the abilities of their peers. Additionally, diversity has been shown to produce more supportive social climates and effective learning environments [4], which can facilitate the mentoring of young scientists. Despite these positive effects, however, quantifying the impact of diversity in science remains exceedingly difficult, due in large part to a lack of comprehensive data about the scientific workforce. Measuring the composition and dynamics of a scientific workforce, particularly in a rapidly expanding field like computer science, is a crucial first step toward understanding how scholarly research is conducted and how it might be enhanced. For many scientific fields, however, there is no central listing of all tenure-track faculty, making it difficult to define a rigorous sample frame for analysis. Further, rates of adoption of services like GoogleScholar and ResearchGate vary within, and across disciplines. For instance, gender representation in computing is an important issue with broad implications [5], but without a full census of computing faculty, the degree of inequality and its possible sources are difficult to establish [6]. Some disciplines, like political science, are organized around a single professional society, whose membership roll approximates a full census [7]. Most fields, on the other hand, including computer science, lack a single all-encompassing organization and membership information is instead distributed across many disjoint lists, such as web-based faculty directories for individual departments. Because assembling such a full census is difficult, past studies have tended to avoid this task and have instead used samples of researchers [8 \u2013 11], usually specific to a particular field [12 \u2013 16], and often focused on the scientific elite [17, 18]. Although useful, such samples are not representative of the scientific workforce as a whole and thus have limited generalizability. One of the largest census efforts to date assembled, by hand, a nearly complete record of three academic fields: computer science, history, and business [19]. This data set has shed considerable light on dramatic inequalities in faculty training, placement, and scholarly productivity [6, 19, 20]. But, this data set is only a single snapshot of an evolving and expanding system and hence offers few insights into the changing composition and diversity trends within these academic fields. In some fields, yearly data on faculty numbers and composition are available in aggregate. In computer science, the Computing Research Association (CRA) documents trends in the employment of PhD recipients through the annual Taulbee survey of computing departments in North America (cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey). Such surveys can provide valuable insight into trends and summary statistics on the scientific workforce but suffer from two key weaknesses. First, surveys are subject to variable response rates and the misinterpretation of questions or sample frames, which can inject bias into fine-grained analyses [21, 22]. Second, aggregate information provides only a high-level view of a field, which can make it difficult to investigate causality [23]. For example, differences in recruitment and retention strategies across departments will be washed out by averaging, thereby masking any insights into the efficacy of individual strategies and policies. Here, we present a novel system, based on a topical web crawler, that can quickly and automatically assemble a full census of an academic field using digital data available on the public World Wide Web. This system is efficient and accurate, and it can be adapted to any academic discipline and used for continuous collection. The system is capable of collecting census data for an entire academic field in just a few hours using off-the-shelf computing hardware, a vast improvement over the roughly 1600 hours required to do this task by hand [19]. By assembling an accurate census of an entire field from online information alone, this system will facilitate new research on the composition of academic fields by providing access to complete faculty listings, without having to rely on surveys or professional societies. This system can also be used longitudinally to study how the workforce\u2019s composition changes over time, which is particularly valuable for evaluating the effectiveness of policies meant to broaden participation or improve retention of faculty. Finally, applied to many academic fields in parallel, the system can elucidate scientists\u2019 movement between different disciplines and relate those labor flows to scientific advances. In short, many important research questions will benefit from the availability of accurate and frequently-recollected census data. Our study is organized as follows. We begin by detailing the design and implementation of our web crawler framework. Next, we present the results of our work in two sections. The first demonstrates the validity and utility of the crawler by collecting census data for the field of computer science and comparing it to a hand-curated census, collected in 2011 [19]. The second provides an example of the type of research enabled by our system and uses the 2011 and 2017 censuses to investigate the \u201cleaky pipeline\u201d problem in faculty retention.", "human1": "This paper presents a Web crawler-based computer system for automatically generating census data for an academic field, which is applied to the compilation of a census of faculty in Computer Science."}, "GUM_academic_economics": {"fulltext": "2. New Institutional Economics: Theoretical Foundations and Application to the Argentine Case 2.1. New Institutional Economics, Property Rights, and Credibility of the State\u2019s Commitment Throughout the second half of the 20th century, we have witnessed the return of institutions to economic analysis. The awarding of the Nobel Prize in Economics to its main representatives (Douglass North, Ronald Coase, Oliver Williamson, and Elinor Ostrom) has contributed to its greater recognition. The two main notions of this economic approach are the concepts of transaction costs and institutions, analyzed by Coase and North, respectively. Coase [13,14] argues that economic transactions involve costs, and where these costs outweigh the gains, the exchange will not take place. For its part, North defined the institutions as the \u201crules of the game\u201d: they determine the structure of the economy, establish incentives for economic behavior, and affect social interaction [12]. Thus, institutions also determine the level of uncertainty to which individuals are subject, stimulating or discouraging transactions. A viable economy requires an institutional structure that reduces existing uncertainty and guarantees property rights. In other words, it is critical that economic agents believe that their property rights will not be taken away by other public or private actors [15]. Achieving these objectives requires the creation of inclusive institutions, which guarantee the right to private property, incorporate an impartial legal system, and promote a society based on equality of conditions [16]. Of course, the state takes a lead role in promoting this type of institution. The state must protect property rights, provide public services, and ensure a sound judiciary. It is responsible also for imposing order and promoting a climate of cooperation among agents, penalizing all violators of contracts [17]. The path to a prosperous society is not an easy one. It is society that establishes, through political processes, the type of economic institutions that are adopted. If there are disagreements about the policies to be implemented, then the group that wins the political game will make the final decision. On the one hand, a society that adopts policies promoting inclusive political institutions will develop pluralist and centralized institutions. Inclusive institutions guarantee the right to private property, to an impartial legal system and promote a society based on equal conditions. These institutions benefit not only the elites, but society as a whole. The consequences of implementing inclusive institutions are reflected in increased activity, productivity, and economic growth. On the other hand, if extractive political institutions are implemented, then power will be consolidated within a small number of groups. In governments with extractive policies, the group in power usually extracts resources from the rest of the population for its own enrichment and well-being. Another feature of this type of government is that powerful interest groups oppose increased pluralism because it typically results in the loss of their privileges. Those in power have little interest in their power devolving to a greater number of agents, as would occur under political institutions that were more pluralistic [16]. It follows that the role of the state is essential. The institutional structure of a state and its constitution are responsible for restricting predatory action\u2014even by the state itself\u2014and for creating rules that benefit the community [18]. Moreover, compliance mechanisms must reflect ex ante and ex post standards [12]. But what happens when property rights are not respected? What if it is the state itself that exhibits predatory behavior? All these questions have a place in this case analysis. The expropriation of YPF is a case in which the Argentine State presents predatory behavior, encouraged by an extractive institutional framework. If the decisions taken by the state are not based on the general interest and, in their execution, do not respect property rights, the number of transactions will be reduced, which will result in unfavorable economic performance. In a scenario with insecure property rights, asymmetric information, and a judicial system that acts as a lax enforcement mechanism, as discussed in the following sections, the FDI is difficult to attract. 2.2. Institutional Structure of the Argentine State In order to understand policymaking and its effects, one must have adequate knowledge of the focal country\u2019s institutional framework. Most of Argentina\u2019s governments have been of the predatory type. The country\u2019s unequal economic growth originated in the colonial era and reflects how the Spanish metropolis influenced the establishment of extractive institutions [7]. Argentine politics are therefore highly unstable. Achieving political order would require the government to limit its actions and guarantee the rights of citizens\u2014neither of which has yet occurred in Argentina.", "human1": "This study discusses the implications of nations appropriating assets in contradiction with property rights using the example of the Argentine State's  expropriation of YPF."}, "GUM_academic_enjambment": {"fulltext": "Distant Rhythm: Automatic Enjambment Detection on Four Centuries of Spanish Sonnets Pablo Ruiz Fabo pabloruizfabo@gmail.com Lattice Lab, CNRS, France Clara Mart\u00ednez Cant\u00f3n cimartinez@flog.uned.es Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Spain Thierry Poibeau thierry.poibeau@ens.fr Lattice Lab, CNRS, France Introduction Enjambment takes place when a syntactic unit is broken up across two lines of poetry (Dom\u00ednguez Caparr\u00f3s, 2000: 103), giving rise to different stylistic effects (e.g. increased emphasis on elements of the broken-up phrase, or contrast between those elements), or creating double interpretations for the enjambed lines (Garc\u00eda-Paje, 1991). In Spanish poetry, the syntactic configurations under which enjambment takes place have been described extensively, and detailed studies on the use of enjambment by individual authors exist (see Mart\u00ednez Cant\u00f3n, 2011 for an overview) including, among others Quilis (1964), Dom\u00ednguez Caparr\u00f3s, (2000), Para\u00edso, (2000), Spang (1983) for a description of enjambment, and Alarcos (1966), Senabre (1982), Luj\u00e1n (2006), Mart\u00ednez Fern\u00e1ndez (2010) for case-studies on a single author. However, a larger-scale study to identify enjambment across hundreds of authors spanning several centuries, enabling distant reading (Moretti, 2013), was not previously available. Given that need, we have developed software, based on Natural Language Processing, that automatically identifies enjambment in Spanish, and applied it to a corpus of approx. 3750 sonnets by ca. 1000 authors, from the 15th to the 19th century. What is the interest of such large-scale automatic analyses of enjambment? First, the literature shows a debate about which specific syntactic units can be considered to trigger enjambment, if split across two lines, and whether lexical and syntactic criteria are sufficient to identify enjambment. Second, the stylistic effects that enjambment permits are also an object of current research (Mart\u00ednez Fern\u00e1ndez, 2010). Systematically collecting large amounts of enjambment examples provides helpful evidence to assess scholars\u2019 current claims, and may stimulate novel analyses. Finally, our study complements Navarro\u2019s (2016) automatic metrical analyses of Spanish Golden Age sonnets, by covering a wider period and focusing on enjambment. The abstract is structured thus: First we provide the definition of enjambment adopted. Then, our corpus and system are described, followed by an evaluation of the system. Finally, findings on enjambment in our diachronic sonnet corpus are discussed. The project\u2019s website provides details omitted here for space reasons, including samples for the corpus, results, and other details. Enjambment in Spanish Syntactic and metrical units often match in poetry. However, this trend has been broken since antiquity for various reasons (Parry (1929) on Homer, or Flores G\u00f3mez (1988) on early classical poetry). In Spanish tradition, enjambment (in Spanish, \"encabalgamiento\") is considered to take place when a pause suggested by poetic form (e.g. at the end of a line or across hemistichs) occurs between strongly connected lexical or syntactic units, triggering an unnatural cut between those units. Quilis (1964) performed poetry reading experiments, proposing that the following strongly connected elements give rise to enjambment, should a poetic-form pause break them up: Lexical enjambment: Breaking up a word. We translated \"lexical enjambment\" from Quilis\u2019s terms \"encabalgamiento l\u00e9xico\" or \"tmesis\". Phrase-bounded enjambment: Within a phrase, breaking up sequences like \"noun + adjective\", \"verb + adverb\", \"auxiliary verb + main verb\", among others. We translated \"phrase-bounded enjambment\" from \"encabalgamiento sirrem\u00e1tico\". Cross-clause enjambment: Between a noun antecedent and the pronoun heading the relative clause that complements the antecedent. We translated \"cross-clause enjambment\" from Quilis\u2019s \"encabalgamiento oracional\". The project site includes Quilis\u2019s complete list of syntactic environments that can trigger enjambment, as well as the types identified by our system. Besides the enjambment types above, Spang (1983) noted that if a subject or direct object and their related verbs occur in two different lines of poetry, this can also feel unusual for a reader, even if the effect is less pronounced than in the environments identified by Quilis. To differentiate these cases from enjambment proper, Spang calls these cases \"enlace\", translated here as \"expansion\". Quilis (1964) was the only author so far to gather recitation-based experimental evidence on enjambment. His typology is still considered current, and was adopted by later authors, although complementary enjambment typologies have been proposed, as Mart\u00ednez Cant\u00f3n (2011) reviews. Our system identifies Quilis\u2019 types, besides Spang\u2019s expansion cases.", "human1": "This paper presents a natural language processing system to identify and study enjambment in a large corpus of Spanish sonnets from the 15th to the 19th century."}, "GUM_academic_epistemic": {"fulltext": "Epistemic pollution Agents can rationally choose between experts only if the criteria that distinguish genuine experts from charlatans are common sense or widely known: if agents are to satisfy the epistemic conditions on responsibility, they must know what kinds of knowledge they must utilize to guide their selection of sources (on pain of infinite regress). In fact, many, if not all, the markers of expertise identified by philosophers enjoy widespread recognition. The fact that these criteria are widely known, however, offers an opportunity to those who would use them for deception, witting or unwitting. Since expertise must be assessed through indirect markers, to mimic the markers of expertise is to mimic expertise [17]. We live in an epistemic environment that is heavily and deliberately polluted by agents who use mimicry and other methods as a means of inflating their pretense to expertise. This fact, together with the fact that such deception is widely known to occur, reduces ordinary people\u2019s trust in expert authority and diminishes their capacity to distinguish reliable from unreliable sources. For instance, those with an interest in deceiving the general public may set up parallel institutions that ostensibly guarantee expertise, taking advantage of the ways in which these parallel institutions mimic legitimate institutions to ensure that people are taken in. There are some egregious examples of this practice in the field of health care. For example, a small number of doctors set up the American College of Pediatricians (ACPeds) to advocate socially conservative viewpoints related to child health care. Such an organization is surely permissible, but it has had the unfortunate (and likely intended) effect of muddying debates in the public forum by misleading people into thinking that the college speaks for the pediatric profession at large. Thus, when ACPeds issued a statement condemning gender reassignment surgery in 2016 [21], many people mistook the organization\u2019s political beliefs for the consensus view among United States pediatricians \u2014 although the peak body for pediatric workers, the American Academy of Pediatrics, has a much more positive view of gender dysphoria [22]. Insofar as the larger organization, with a broader membership base, can be expected to reflect a wider range of expert opinions and a higher degree of expertise, it is reasonable to give its views greater weight than those of the smaller organization. When ACPeds allows or encourages the impression that it speaks for the profession, it introduces an epistemic pollutant. A yet more egregious example of such pollution involved collaborative efforts by pharmaceutical companies and the publishing giant Elsevier to produce publications mimicking peer-reviewed journals in the interest of promoting the companies\u2019 commercial products [23]. The companies hoped to leverage the prestige of Elsevier with these fake journals to endow their promotional \u201cresearch\u201d with an air of reliability. When the deceit was uncovered, however, the effect was just the opposite: the legitimacy of the published findings was not enhanced through their publication by Elsevier, but rather the legitimacy of Elsevier\u2019s publications \u2014 and, by extension, all academic journals \u2014 was diminished through their dissemination of deceptive and commercially interested research. More recently, institutions of academic expertise have been subject to a large and growing outbreak of so-called predatory journals \u2014 journals that will publish almost anything for a fee. Once again, this phenomenon has the effect of making peer-reviewed journals appear less legitimate. At times, even those who work in academia may be unsure of a particular journal\u2019s legitimacy, and there are genuine borderline cases. For example, the Frontiers contingent of journals appears legitimate \u2014 at least to me \u2014 despite the fact that authors are expected to pay a publication fee. 8 Yet some Frontiers journals appear to have engaged in bad behavior, whether for profit or for some other motive. Frontiers in Public Health controversially published articles linking vaccines and autism [24] and questioning the link between HIV and AIDS [25]. Whether due to this behavior or not, Jeffrey Beall decided to add the publisher to his influential (but now sadly unavailable) list of questionable journals [26]. The controversy surrounding Beall\u2019s decision indicates how difficult it is to make such judgments \u2014 even for professionals. If academics with expertise in relevant fields have difficulty assessing whether particular journals or particular publishers are legitimate, one cannot reasonably expect ordinary people to make such judgments. If their confidence in scientific findings is lowered across the board as the result of such epistemic pollution, one can hardly blame them. Since conflicts of interest are a reason to discount expertise, it is incumbent on me to note that I have published in Frontiers journals on several occasions. Epistemic pollution may stem not only from counterfeit institutions of knowledge production but also from bad behavior by legitimate institutions. 9 For example, pollution may result from attempts to game the systems put in place to track expertise. Consider institutions with a credentialing function, such as universities, bar associations, or peer review bodies. These institutions do not exist solely to credential experts. They have other functions, and these functions may come into conflict, creating pressures to inflate credentials. For example, universities have a financial incentive to inflate the expertise of their academic staff, thereby increasing their rankings, bringing in grant money, and attracting students. Systems that assess expertise can be manipulated, and many cases of such manipulation exist \u2014 take the recent example by the University of Malaysia, which attempted to boost metrics by urging its faculty to cite one another [28]. For this reason, institutions may also be slow to investigate accusations of fraud, and they may try to keep their discoveries in-house to protect their reputations.", "human1": "This paper explains epistemic pollution, the result of an environment in which scholarly information may be false or deceptive, using examples of the potential harm caused by this phenomenon."}, "GUM_academic_exposure": {"fulltext": "Introduction Research on adult-learned second language (L2) has provided considerable insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the learning and processing of L2 grammar [1]\u2013[11]. Of interest here, studies suggest that, despite the difficulties in acquiring L2 grammar, adult learners can approximate native-like levels of use and neurocognitive processing [12]\u2013[15]. However, it is not enough to have attained such native-like levels. Crucially, it is also desirable to retain them, even in the absence of continued practice or exposure to the L2. In fact, substantial periods (months to years) of limited or no exposure following L2 training are not uncommon, and may even be the norm [16]. Such a scenario may be found in different situations, including when one studies a language in a classroom and then stops taking classes [17], [18] and when one is immersed in a foreign language setting and then moves away [19]. In the present study, we examine the outcomes of such a period of no exposure on the neurocognition of L2 grammar: that is, whether a substantial period of no exposure leads to decreased proficiency and/or less native-like neural processes (\u201cuse it or lose it\u201d [20]), no such changes, or perhaps whether even higher proficiency and/or more native-like processing may be observed. Additionally, we test whether any such outcomes might vary as a function of the type of L2 training, in particular between classroom-like and immersion-like contexts. Previous Research We are aware of six studies designed to investigate the effects of a substantial period of limited exposure following adult L2 training [17], [18], [21]\u2013[24], all of which were restricted to the examination of behavioral (performance) outcomes. (Note that we do not consider case studies, purely observational data, or research on L2s acquired by children; for a comprehensive review, see [16]). The six studies tested L2 learners after periods of 1 month to 50 years of limited L2 exposure, mainly on general language skills [17], [18], [21], [23], [24], though also on more specific paradigms meant to target aspects of grammatical abilities [17], [18] or lexical abilities [22], [23]. These language measures were compared in most studies to the same measures in a different set of subjects who had not experienced a period of limited exposure [17], [18], [22], [23], or to retrospective ratings of the same subjects [21], with only one longitudinal study testing the same subjects before and after a period of limited exposure [24]. Across the studies, the periods of limited exposure followed either classroom training [17], [18], [22], [24] or mixed classroom and immersion training [21], [23], [24]. The training lasted varying lengths of time, apparently usually in the range of a few years, and resulted in seemingly varying proficiency levels (though not directly measured, except by [24]) prior to the period of limited exposure. Overall, the results of the six studies have been taken to suggest the following. A period of limited exposure generally leads to attrition (loss) of L2 performance or knowledge [17], [18], [21], [23]. Such loss has been observed after as little as a few months of limited exposure, e.g., after a 1-7 month [23] or 6 month delay [21], as well as after 2 years [18], though in one case it was observed only by 3-5 years, and not earlier [17]. Although attrition may take place within the first few years, some studies suggest that it then appears to level off, with no further losses occurring [17], [18]. Higher levels of proficiency (or exposure) may be associated with less attrition [17], [18], [21], [23] or even with no observed losses [21]. Moreover, one study found no changes at all in performance, across proficiency levels, after either 2 or 4 years of limited exposure [22]. Finally, in some cases a gain in performance has been observed: after 1.5 years of limited exposure in one study, particularly for L2 learners with immersion as well as classroom training [24], and in another study after 2 years, though only for some abilities, such as listening and reading comprehension [18]. It remains unclear what might explain such gains, which have been attributed to motivation and to L2 experience during the period of ostensibly limited exposure [24], or to factors related to general maturation, cognitive development, or continued academic training [18].", "human1": "This study shows that limited exposure to a second language (L2) after it is no longer being actively used generally causes attrition of L2 competence."}, "GUM_academic_games": {"fulltext": "The Use of Cognitive Digital Games in School: Contributions to Attention Daniela Karine Ramos dadaniela@gmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin Bruna Anastacio brunaanastacio@hotmail.com Universidade Federal de Santa Catarin Cognitive games involve a number of different games working aspects of human cognition, while proposing the intersection between the sets of concepts, fun and cognition, for the improvement of cognitive functions. The attention is the main point made in this study, since it is fundamental to the learning process and be recurring complaint among parents and teachers in schools. With respect to the contributions of digital games to improvement of cognitive processes, researchers suggest that regular practice has a significant influence on improving the performance related to basic visual skills (Li, Polat, Scalzo, & Bavelier, 2010); on the ability to perceive objects simultaneously (Dye & Bavelier, 2010; Feng, Spence, & Pratt, 2007); and on the ability to do more than one task at the same time (Boot, Kramer, Simons, Fabiani, & Gratton, 2008). Other studies specifically investigate the use of digital games in the school context and suggest potential for digital game use to improve of student's attention span at preschool age (Rueda, Checa, & C\u00f3mbita, 2012), to improve overall intelligence capacity of elementary school children (Miller & Robertson, 2010), and to better performance of working memory ability (Klingberg et al., 2005; Thorell, Lindqvist, Nutley, Bohlin, & Klingberg, 2009). Considering the importance of the proper functioning of attention, because of its involvement in the regulation of thoughts and emotions, maintaining the performance of this process is very important, especially in school, where the child must acquire content in an environment full of countless distractors. The study in question focuses on the attention, proposing and evaluation in the context of the classroom. Thus, it suggests the use of digital games in an integrated way the school activities in the classroom. The games have features like increasing challenges, rules that establish what can and cannot be done, and involvement of the player in the quest to gain skills and win the game (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004; Prensky, 2005). We aim to investigate the contributions of the use of a system that integrates cognitive digital games to a database, of the Escola do C\u00e9rebro, for monitoring and improvement of cognitive skills, highlighting the attention. The games involve challenges and rules involving the exercise of cognitive functions, especially the working memory, attention and capacity of solving problems. The study combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. It collects the data based on the observation of the proposed interventions as well as interviews conducted with participating teachers and students to identify their perceptions of digital games\u2019 contributions to the learning process. Furthermore, before and after the implementation of the intervention, we performed a D2 Test of attention that measures selective and sustained attention, as well as visual scanning accuracy and speed. The intervention consisted in the use of the Escola do C\u00e9rebro, using tablets in the classroom, daily for a period of five weeks. The sample consisted of 71 students of the Application School of Basic Education, Federal University of Santa Catarina, aged 7 and 9 years old (M The first (n The Escola do C\u00e9rebro is a platform that integrates seven digital games into a database. The application allows visualization of the player's performance and offers the possibility of monitoring by teachers. Students have their scores measured by four variables: time, speed, stability and accuracy. A statistical analysis was performed based on the application of the paired t-test on the difference of the overall score obtained in the test before and after the intervention in the two groups. The difference in the results obtained from the application of D2 Test of attention before and after was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the participant group had mean and standard deviation 60.23 (64.75) respectively, while the control group was 20.00 (42.65). The result indicates significant improvement in the performance of the sustained attention in the test, as well as a high dispersion, which reveals a variation in relation to the performance. In addition, students participating in the interview reported a preference for games that involve problem solving, recognize the need to plan actions in relation to their importance for the game and for daily activities, and realize improvements in the ability to sustain attention. The teachers observed changes after the intervention, emphasizing the greater persistence and involvement in school activities, and in some students, improvement in the ability to sustain attention. From this, we conclude that an intervention based on cognitive digital games offers contributions to the learning process and improvement of sustained attention.", "human1": "This study presents an experiment which demonstrates the efficacy of digital cognitive games for improving children's attention spans at school."}, "GUM_academic_huh": {"fulltext": "Introduction A fundamental tenet of linguistic science is that the sound of a word has a purely arbitrary connection to the word's meaning [1], [2]. Thus, the sound of the word dog in English is connected to the concept \u2018dog\u2019 by historical accident and not by any natural connection; roughly the same concept is just as well denoted in French by chien, in German by hund, and in Japanese by inu. But it is not that a word can have just any vocal sound. While the possibility space for sound systems of the world's language is enormous, any given language makes use of only a restricted portion of the possible sounds [3], [4]. It follows from these two basic principles \u2013 the \u2018arbitrariness of the sign\u2019, and the \u2018selectiveness of particular sound systems\u2019 \u2013 that the words that exist in the world's languages should sound quite different from each other, and that the likelihood that there are universal words is extremely small. But in this study we present a striking exception to this otherwise robust rule. From a systematic comparison of 10 spoken languages from 5 continents we find evidence suggesting that a word like \u2018Huh?\u2019 \u2013 used as a \u2018repair initiator\u2019 when, for example, one has not clearly heard what someone just said [5], [6] \u2013 is a universal word. There are two distinct claims being made here: 1. that Huh? is universal, and 2. that Huh? is a word. In support of the first claim, we show that the similarities in form and function of an interjection with the specific function of repair initiation are very much greater across languages than chance coincidence would admit. In fact the variation in form in unrelated languages across the globe is about the same as the variation we find in the way any regular word (e.g., dog) is pronounced across dialects of English. In support of the second claim, we show that Huh? meets the criteria of a word in the sense of being a conventional lexical sign which must be learnt. Thus, in contrast to what has been presumed for interjections in general [7], [8] and for huh? in particular [9], [10], we find that this item is linguistic in nature rather than being a mere grunt or non-lexical sound. We show that the form is locally calibrated in ways that show it fitting within different language systems. Huh? may be a non-prototypical word, but it is a word. Finally, we address the question of why all languages should have such a word and why its form should be so similar across languages. We observe that this item fulfils a crucial need shared by all languages \u2013 the efficient signalling of problems of hearing and understanding \u2013 and we propose that its form is constrained by selective pressures in a conversational environment that is essentially the same in all languages. Consider a case from English [10]: Extract 1 American English [NB, 1:1:19] After speaker G makes a statement, speaker E utters the interjection huh?. This is followed by a repetition of the original statement by G. The technical term for this type of sequence is \u201copen other-initiated repair\u201d: repair is initiated not by the speaker of the first turn but by the other participant (\u201cother-initiated\u201d), and the repair initiator signals that there is a problem, but it leaves open what the problem is (\u201copen\u201d) [11]. The actual repair operation in response to this interjection is usually simply repetition, sometimes with slight modification. Extracts 2 and 3 show structurally identical sequences in two other languages: Siwu, a Kwa language spoken in Ghana, and Lao, a Tai-Kadai language spoken in Laos. Extract 2 Siwu (Ghana) [Maize1_1017013] Extract 3 Lao (Laos) [CONV_050815c_03.10] These examples show that it is possible to identify the same conversational structure in unrelated languages. Essentially, this method gives us a natural control over conversational data, making possible systematic comparison across languages [12], [13]. Sequences of other-initiated repair have been identified in every spoken language investigated so far [14], [15], and as the examples show, the interjection in the pivotal turn can be remarkably similar. This leads to the question driving our study: is huh? in this context a universal word? By compiling data from published literature we found that in thirty-one languages around the world, the interjection for other-initiated repair appears to be strongly similar (Figure 1). However, written sources are rarely explicit about the precise form, meaning, and use of interjections. The most reliable way to study a conversational interjection is by examining cases of actual use. Therefore we collected data from recordings of naturally occurring informal conversations in a sample of 10 languages from 5 continents, varying fundamentally in terms of phonology, word structure, and grammar (languages 1\u201310 in Figure 1). For optimal comparability, we studied the exact same conversational environment across languages: that of other-initiated repair (OIR), in which one participant produces a turn at talk, the other then signals some trouble with this turn, and finally the first produces a next turn which aims to solve the trouble, usually by means of repetition and/or modification. In some languages the interjection, or an item similar to it, was also found in other sequential environments, for instance to mark surprise or to pursue a response. Such alternative (and probably derived) uses provide insight in possible paths of semantic change, but we exclude them here to make sure we are comparing like with like.", "human1": "Using literature on 31 lanuages and recorded data from 10 languages, this paper argues that 'huh' is a universal word used across languages by listeners to initiate repair in conversation when they do not understand speakers."}, "GUM_academic_implicature": {"fulltext": "4. Discussion. We hypothesized that the children, who were over the age of six at the time of collection, would have adult-like SI interpretations. We expected that the use of a training session and then the format of the question would guide participants towards evaluating pragmatic felicity over providing truth value judgments, and would result in adult-like interpretations. Further, we posited that if our initial hypothesis was not supported, and in fact there was some non-adult-like performance, that there would be significant variability among the conditions, with cardinal numbers having the highest performance and some the weakest. On the surface, it does seem as if there is variability and perhaps a larger sample size or more items could lead to a significant finding (see limitations below), but at least for this study, the only significant finding was the difference between cardinal numbers and some. Significant differences were not observed between all and cardinal numbers or all and some. 4.1. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. This study is limited in its power and generalizability. It serves as a reminder of the work that needs to be completed for the cross-linguistic study of SI in particular and acquisition more generally. Bantu languages are not included in studies of acquisition often enough despite the numerous languages in this linguistic grouping and the millions of people using them. Future studies need to include more participants and more items to increase power. Future studies should also include a larger age range of children to document the age at which adult-like performance emerges. Related cross-cultural studies have resulted in insufficient statistical power, but interesting trends (e.g., Nedwick, 2014). Follow-up studies with increased stimuli and participants are needed. In a future study, it is also important to consider if additional training in the difference between reporting on felicity and truth value judgments would impact results, or if more naturalistic experimental conditions (e.g., demonstrating actions using real objects instead of two-dimensional depictions) would be beneficial. Previous studies in this region of sub-Saharan Africa have found evidence of cultural differences in testing behavior (Hein, Reich, Marks, Thuma, & Grigorenko, 2016). The current study is too small to make strong conclusions with regard to cultural differences and experimental methods; however, in the study by Hein and colleagues it was found that children responded more or less frequently based on factors such as stimuli type. In the current study, the responses from two children were not included because they responded the same way to every item through the training and all test items. More specifically, they answered \u201cyes\u201d that the puppet described the pictures well. It is possible that these two children understood the task and really did believe that the puppet did not produce any poor descriptions, and in this regard, are not yet adult-like in their SI interpretations. This is unlikely as they said that even the first training item was said well. It is also possible though that these two children were attempting to please the data collectors, or be polite, and that \u201cyes\u201d was in some ways a default answer to be provided when having to respond verbally in a test context. Additional training with the methodology could improve outcomes. The puppets used were picked specifically for this task with careful attention to their appearance. Upon arrival at the school, however, it became clear that the children were not accustomed to playing with puppets and that the data collection would be a novel experience for them. Further exploration with greater cardinal number ranges could also prove interesting. Numbers through five in the participating communities are most often expressed with native Chitonga words while numbers greater than five are typically indicated using English borrowings. The cardinal numbers included in this study were only one through five in order to avoid additional item variability, but larger numbers should be included in future research. 5. Conclusion. Albeit limited, these results provide valuable insight into SI interpretation by Chitonga-speaking children and demonstrate that pragmatic inference acquisition likely follows the order identified in previous research, but appears to be completed at a later age in this language. This interesting combination of findings \u2013 expected hierarchy of difficulty, but differing age of acquisition \u2013 is an important addition to our growing cross-linguistic knowledge of SI and could be the result of language-specific differences in the use of SI lexical items or methodological differences.", "human1": "This discussion concludes based on experimental results that Chitonga speaking children acquire pragmatic competence in Scalar Implicature (SI) in the order known from previous studies."}, "GUM_academic_librarians": {"fulltext": "Digital Humanities Clinics - Leading Dutch Librarians into DH Michiel Cock m.p.cock@vu.nl Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands Lotte Wilms lotte.wilms@kb.nl National Library of the Netherlands, the Netherlands In 2015, an initiative was started to set up a Dutch speaking DH+Lib community in the Netherlands and Belgium, based on the example of the American communal space of librarians, archivists, LIS graduate students, and information specialists to discuss topics \u2018Where the Digital Humanities and Libraries meet\u2019. At the initial meeting it became apparent that most participants were there to learn more about digital humanities and were not (yet) in the situation where they were able to offer expertise on the subject. On the administrative level, the directors of the libraries participating in the consortium of Dutch academic libraries (UKB) also expressed the wish that librarians become more fluent in DH. A year later, the National Library of the Netherlands (Koninklijke Bibliotheek), and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam again concluded that librarians at their institutes who wanted to get involved in DH needed more training to adequately support researchers and students in this field. Therefore both institutes joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians. The two institutes were later joined by the Leiden University Libraries. We see this as the ideal opportunity to provide these educative sessions not only to our own librarians, but also to the academic librarians of other Dutch research libraries. In essence, we want to teach our country\u2019s librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects. The aim of these clinics is to provide basic methodological competencies and technical skills in DH, for a diverse group of librarians, consisting of both subject and technical librarians with basic technical skills. The content of these sessions should enable them to provide services to researchers and students, identify remaining gaps in knowledge or skills that they could address by self-directed learning and (perhaps) to automate their daily library work. We are not setting out to turn them into programmers or data crunchers, but want to boost their knowledge level to where they feel comfortable providing information about DH projects, follow the literature and research, follow online tutorials and hopefully take up the challenge of finishing this professional development by engaging with the DH community. In order to design this curriculum we follow a four step approach with a Working Out Loud-principle (Williams, 2010): Desk research about what being a DH librarian entails (e.g. Hartsell-Gundy et al., 2015; Mulligan, 2016; also see the Zotero library of the LIBER Digital Humanities working group); Identify possible subjects, based on experience, a comparison of existing teaching material related to DH (e.g. The Programming Historian, the Digital Scholarship Training Programme at the British Library and Columbia University's Developing Librarian project) and the TaDiRAH taxonomy of research activities; Get feedback from researchers on possible subjects, based on the knowledge and skills they feel librarians need; Get feedback from librarians on possible subjects, based on already known gaps in their knowledge and skills. With these in hand, we will design the curriculum of clinics, based on the method of 'constructive alignment' (Biggs et al., 2011), to make sure that the intended learning objectives and the teaching/learning activities stay aligned. Our plan is to organize a maximum of 6 clinics, each one full day. Each day starts with one or more lectures by researchers, that address the conceptual knowledge needed. The afternoon sessions will be devoted to the hands-on training of skills, following the Library Carpentry model as closely as possible. By having researchers provide the lecture sessions, we hope to fuel the enthusiasm of the librarians with the inspiration of direct contact with researchers and to provide access to a network within and across universities. With these clinics, we hope to initiate a stream of DH activities in Dutch universities, making access to support easier for new digital scholars.

Today\u2019s generation will not survive a day without the help of lighting. In fact, someone\u2019s productivity, particularly at night, depends on the presence of a good lighting and it seems that it is a daily necessity. Lighting takes a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy particularly in the Philippines. There are different type of lighting bulbs used at home can affect the overall lighting consumption. Nowadays, most commonly and widely used bulb in the household is the Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL). However, the main problem of CFL is the mercury they contain. In addition to this is the harmful effect of mercury such as Emission of UV Radiation. In response to the said problem, this project study gives solution to the problem of the society concerning environment, health and safety as well energy conservation, by developing a segmented compact light-emitting diode (SCLED) bulb from busted CFL that are efficient, economical, and does not contain toxic chemicals. 1. Introduction Based on the results of the 2011 Household Energy Consumption Survey (HECS), electricity remains as the most common source of energy used by households particularly in the Philippines. About 87 percent of 21.0 million households used electricity from March to August 2011. As of 2016, the demand for electricity in the residential is leading among the different sectors. It is often grouped depending on its uses that are distributed for heating and cooling, lighting, operating appliances etc [1] Figure 1. January-june 2016 philippine power demand Now that the world is in the age where lighting seems to be a daily necessity, typical homes as shown in figure 1, consume nearly 27 percent of the energy used today: making lighting as the major source of electricity consumption. Lighting plays a large part on the consumption of household electrical energy; it consumes about 18% of the total generated electricity of total energy consumption in residential sectors as shown in figure 2 [2]. Figure 2. Estimated electricity use in residential sector One of the main factors in lighting energy consumption is the light bulb. The use of correct and appropriate type of light bulb improves the efficiency of energy usage. There are three general types of lighting that are widely used in the household nowadays: the (light-emitting diode) LED bulb, (compact fluorescent light) CFL bulb and the incandescent bulb. But each of them has their perks and perils [3]. Unfortunately, most of the time, people in the residential end up choosing a lamp based on it is price rather than its efficiency and this cause us to pay for our lighting more than necessary. Today, CFLs are the most used lighting sources in the household. Using CFLs will allow people to decrease their energy consumption; also it is a good start to decrease greenhouse emissions. However, the main problem of CFLs is the mercury they contain. When products and wastes containing mercury are improperly disposed of, mercury is released into the air, ground or water. It is persistent in the environment; it never breaks down nor goes away. In addition to the harmful effects of mercury is that it emits Ultraviolet (UV) Radiation. This UV radiation interacts with the chemicals on the inside of the bulb to generate light. The acute and chronic effects are the normal responses of the skin to UVR; acute reactions considered will be erythema (sunburn) and vitamin D production. Skin aging and skin cancer will be discussed as those reactions produced by prolonged or repeated UVR exposure [4]. In response to the aforementioned situation where the three types of lights are compared by their efficiency and effectiveness as light sources, the proponents conducted this study. Since the CFLs are the most commonly used light bulbs in the residential and has a great compatibility to LED in terms of design and materials, the proponents conducted a study about innovating and recycling CFL into a more efficient and environment friendly LED light bulb.", "human1": "Motivated by their popularity and environmental impact in the Philippines, this paper presents a project recycling busted Compact Fluorescent Light (CFL) bulbs into more efficient and environmentally friendly Light-Emitting Diode (LED) light bulbs."}, "GUM_academic_mutation": {"fulltext": "Design of Mutation Operators for Testing Geographic Information Systems Suilen H.

Abstract: In this article, we propose the definition of specific mutation operators for testing Geographic Information Systems. We describe the process for applying the operators and generating mutants, and present a case study where these mutation operators are applied to two real-world applications. Keywords: mutation operators; geographic information systems; mutation testing 1. Introduction Mutation-based testing [1] is a test technique that involves artificially introducing errors into a System Under Test (SUT). A mutant is a copy of the system in which a change has been done that, in most cases, will lead to a behaviour different than expected. The different mutants are generated automatically by the application of mutation operators. In the state of the art, we have found mutation operators, both general purpose and specific to different technologies, languages and paradigms [2\u20139]. However, these operators are not adequate when trying to test software features associated with specific domains. In this article, we propose mutation operators specific to the domain of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications. These operators reproduce programming errors that are litely to occur during the development of this type of applications. In addition, we present the implementation of these operators and as proof of concept we apply these operators to two real-world GIS applications and we generate the mutants. 2. Mutation Operators for GIS As a previous step to designing the mutation operators, we analyzed the main technologies used specifically in the development of GIS, and we identified typical errors a programmer can introduce during the development. These errors were formalized into mutation operators. In order to apply these operators to a SUT, we rely on Java reflection and aspect-oriented programming. Reflection allows us to obtain the list of classes and methods of the SUT, so the user can decide the methods to wish the operators will be applied. Later, we capture information about the methods of the SUT to be mutated, together with the information of the mutation operators that were already defined. From these data, we generate the mutation operator, in the form of on aspect, which will then be possible to interweave with the SUT which generates a mutant of the SUT. Next, we describe the definition of two operators and two cases of application on real-world GIS applications. ChangeCoordSys Operator (Listing 1): It exchanges the coordinate system of a geometry, so it does not match the coordinate system that is being used in the user interface. It simulates the error of not checking that the coordinate system is correct. The error is introduced by directly modifying the coordinate system of geometry when recovering the wrapping of the figure. Listing 1: A simplified definition of the ChangeCoordSys Operator. This operator was applied to a mobile technology GIS application. This application allows registering places of interest for the user. These areas of interest are called Geofences. A Geofence is determined by a geographical location expressed in terms of latitude, longitude, and a radius around that location. By creating a Geofence with an erroneous location from its central location, the device will receive incorrect location notifications. As a result, the user will see in the application\u2019s map viewer the Geofences drawn in erroneous zones (Figure 1). Figure 1. Original and mutant application. BooleanPolygonConstraint Operator (Listing 2): It introduces errors in the processing of geometries, manipulating the result of the operations that carry out the verification of different topological restrictions between geometries, such as intersects, covers or overlap. Listing 2: A simplified definition of the BooleanPolygonConstraint Operator. To test this operator it was applied to a land reparcelling system. The objective of the land reparcelling is to reunify the lands of an owner to facilitate their exploitation. In this application, the result of the operation between two polygons has been affected. This error causes the incorrect display of the resulting geometry that should be drawn in the user interface after the operation applied to the two initial geometries (Figure 2). Figure 2. Original and mutant application. 3. Conclusions In existing proposals, we can find both generic and specific mutation operators. However, these are not adequate to cover errors in particular domains. We have defined new operators specific to the GIS domain and a way to apply them to a SUT. In addition, we have tested the operators defined in two GIS applications. As future work, we intend to extend this approach to other domains, as well as to use the developed operators for the automatic improvement of sets of test cases.", "human1": "This paper presents a study of mutation operators, which simulate likely software errors for testing purposes, in the area of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)."}, "GUM_academic_replication": {"fulltext": "Replication in Second Language Research: Narrative and Systematic Reviews and Recommendations for the Field Replication studies are considered by many to play a fundamental role in any scientific endeavor. When using the same materials and procedures as a previous study, replication studies serve to test the reliability of the previous study\u2019s findings. When altering specific methodological or participant characteristics of a previous study, they serve to test generalizability of the earlier findings under different conditions. One indication of the importance of replication is found in the 50 or more calls for replication research in the field of second language (L2) research alone (see references for 50 calls and commentaries in Appendix S1 in the Supporting Information online): from Santos (1989) through Polio and Gass 1997 to very recent proposals for specific replication studies, such as Vandergrift and Cross 2017 and even a book-length treatment (Porte, 2012). Beyond these calls, efforts to actively promote and facilitate replication studies have also emerged. For example, the Instruments for Research into Second Languages (IRIS) repository (http://www.irisdatabase.org) was established in 2011 and holds, at the time of writing, over 3,800 materials that can be used for replication, among other purposes, in L2 research (Marsden & Mackey, 2014; Marsden, Mackey, & Plonsky, 2016). The Open Science Framework (https://osf.io), also established in 2011, provides a web infrastructure to facilitate collaboration and has been used for large replication efforts in psychology (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015), which continue to make waves in academia (Laws, 2016; Lindsay, 2015; Martin & Clarke, 2017) and the general media (Baker, 2015; Devlin, 2016). In some fields, a flourishing metascience, that is, the scientific study of science (see Munaf\u00f2 et al., 2017), has included syntheses assessing the quantity and nature of replication efforts, for example, in education (Makel & Plucker, 2014 and in psychology (Makel et al., 2012). The driving force behind this battery of calls, commentaries, infrastructure, and metascience is a perceived crisis in the state of replication research. The severe concerns underpinning the alleged crisis have several dimensions relating to: (a) the (small) amount of published replication research; (b) the (poor) quality of replication research; and (c) the (lack of) reproducibility, which refers to the extent to which findings can (not) be reproduced in replication attempts that have been undertaken. These concerns speak to the very core of science, raising fundamental questions about the validity and reliability of our work. Indeed, some commentators have called replication the \u201cgold standard\u201d of research evidence (Jasny, Chin, Chong, & Vignieri, 2011, p. 1225) and a \u201clinchpin of the scientific process\u201d (Let\u2019s replicate, 2006, p. 330). In the field of L2 research, given the importance of replication and the 50 calls for replication in L2 research that we identified, one might expect a substantial number of published replication studies by now. However, a perceived lack of prestige, excitement, and originality of replication plagues L2 research (Porte, 2012), as it does other disciplines (Berez-Kroeker et al., 2017; Branco, Cohen, Vossen, Ide, & Calzolari, 2017; Chambers, 2017; Schmidt, 2009), and these perceptions are thought to have caused, at least in part (directly or indirectly), alleged low rates and a poor quality of published replication studies. However, a systematic metascience on replication research has not yet been established in the field of L2 research, leaving a poor understanding of the actual number and nature of replication studies that have been published. The current study begins to address this gap through narrative and systematic reviews. The narrative review considers challenges in replication research and is largely informed by commentaries and metascience from psychology, given that the cognitive and social subdomains of psychology are highly influential in L2 research, and also from education, another key sister discipline. The narrative review is organized around four broad themes: (a) the quantity of replication research, (b) the nature of replication research, (c) the relationship between initial and replication studies, and (d) the interpretation and extent of reproducibility of the findings of initial studies. To gain insight into these issues in the context of L2 research, the systematic review provides a synthesis of L2 studies in journal articles that self-labeled as replications. The research questions and methods of the systematic review were largely determined by the narrative review but also emerged through the design and piloting of the coding instrument. Finally, we offer further discussion and 16 recommendations for future replication work that draw on our narrative and systematic reviews and on our experience of carrying out multisite (Morgan-Short et al., 2018) 1 and single site (Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short, 2011; Marsden, Williams, & Liu, 2013; McManus & Marsden, 2017; Morgan-Short, Heil, Botero-Moriaty, & Ebert, 2012) replications. We start from the widely agreed premise that testing the reproducibility of findings should have an essential role in the testing and refinement of theory, at least for hypothesis-testing epistemologies that seek to ascertain generalizability and for other epistemologies in which constructs are deemed to be definable and observable. Thus, our overall aim is to provide conceptual clarification and an empirical base for future discussion and production of replication studies, with a view to improving the amount and quality of L2 replication research.", "human1": "This study argues for the establishment of a metascience studying the methodology of replication studies in second language acquisition and presents a narrative review of the field as well as a systematic review of replication studies in this area."}, "GUM_academic_salinity": {"fulltext": "1. Introduction Salinity is one of the most important marine parameters, which controls many processes such as physical circulations, biogeochemistry dynamics from regional to global ocean [1,2]. Although drifters and buoys, together with cruises, have accumulated large amount in-situ water salinity data in different regions, it is still difficult to monitor global ocean salinity with high temporal-spatial resolution by the in situ measurements. In the past decade, with the successful launch of the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) satellite by the European Space Agency (ESA) [3], the Aquarius/SAC-D satellite [4], and the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite [5,6] by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), global sea surface salinity (SSS) observations from space have become possible and a significant improvement has been made to understand the ocean dynamics and climate change. The early concept of remote sensing of SSS has been demonstrated in the late 1970s with observations by Skylab [7] and two airborne L-band radiometry experiments [8,9]. At the end of 1990, two airborne microwave interferometers, the electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) and the scanning low-frequency microwave radiometer (SLFMR), successfully produced SSS maps in coastal areas in agreement with in-situ measurements with an accuracy of about 1 psu. Based on many experiments, the L-band is evidenced as the optimal frequency for remote sensing of SSS, which has been adopted by SMOS, Aquarius/SAC-D and SMAP. However, the sensitivity of satellite measured brightness temperature to SSS is quite low. For example, the sensitivity of vertically polarized brightness temperature to SSS variation is 0.4 to 0.8 K/psu for different observing angles and sea surface temperatures (SST), and it is only 0.2 to 0.6 K/psu for the horizontal polarization brightness temperature [10]. Thus, remote sensing of SSS requires a highly accurate retrieval model. It is widely accepted that the corrections of the sea surface and atmospheric effects are essential for remote sensing of SSS, since these effects could alter the value of sensor-measured brightness temperature and introduce errors into the SSS retrieval process. Besides the atmospheric effects, the increasing of sea surface emissivity due to the sea surface roughness and foam effects is the main source of error, which could significantly hamper the accuracy of SSS retrieval [11]. Over the past decades, the correction for sea surface roughness effects were studied based on the in-situ and airborne measurements; for example, the experiments made from a tower [12], wind and salinity experiments (WISE) [13,14], airborne Passive-Active L-band Sensor (PALS) campaign [15] and Combined Airborne Radio instruments for Ocean and Land Studies (CAROLS) campaigns [16,17]. Many rough surface emission models have also been developed based on the theoretical and empirical methods. Among these models, the small-slope approximation/small perturbation model (SSA / SPM) [18,19,20,21], two scale model (TSM) [22,23,24] and empirical/semi-empirical models [25,26] have been widely used by the research community and implemented in different satellite data processing systems. As the foam effect is significant at high wind speed conditions (above a threshold of 12 m/s) due to strong wave breaking, it has been corrected by numerous models; for example, the semi-empirical models [27,28] and radiative transfer equation (RTE) based models [29,30], which were developed to estimate the foam covered sea surface emissivity. Although many theoretical and empirical models have been developed, some problems are still unsolved. For example, the TSM originally proposed to estimate brightness temperature at higher frequencies, uses the sea surface wave spectrum by multiplying a factor of 2. However, whether this modification can be applied to L-band is still unclear, and the choice of cutoff wavenumber is arbitrary and needs to be clarified in the L-band. Moreover, the sea surface reflection of downwelling atmospheric emission is another contribution to satellite-observed brightness temperature [31], thus the determination of the cutoff wavenumber is required not only for sea surface emission but also for reflection. In addition, the widely used empirical models decouple the wind effect from SSS and SST effects, which means that the surface emission is due to a perfectly flat sea surface and the wind-roughened sea surface. The wind-roughened sea surface is associated with the increased brightness temperature (due to sea surface roughness effect), which induces regional biases when applied to different areas [32]. Furthermore, the satellite measurements of SSS are hampered by the effect of radio frequency interference (RFI) in offshore areas of China (i.e., Bohai sea, Yellow sea and East China sea), which causes a large amount of data to be discarded [33]. Thus, the compatibility of these models in coastal area of China needs to be assessed and tested in order to achieve higher accuracies of SSS from the space-borne observations.", "human1": "This paper examines challenges in monitoring global ocean salinity levels, presenting previous studies and methods and discussing their shortcomings."}, "GUM_academic_theropod": {"fulltext": "Discussion We have shown that the addition of an artificial tail during ontogeny can produce postural and locomotory changes in chickens, consistent with the posture and kinematics inferred for non-avian dinosaurs [5], [6], [11]. The posterior displacement of the CoM produced a more vertically oriented femur during standing (femur in experimental animals was 40% more vertical than control subjects), and increased femoral retraction and decreased knee flexion during walking. These results indicate a shift from the standard bird, knee-driven bipedal locomotion to a more hip-driven locomotion, typical of crocodilians (the only other extant archosaur group), mammals, and hypothetically, bipedal non-avian dinosaurs. These postural and kinematics changes cannot be attributed to an increased weight as subjects of the control-weight group did not show the same changes as the experimental group. In fact, the control-weight subjects showed a more horizontally oriented femur during walking with respect to the control group, similar to that observed in Carrano and Biewener's experimental subjects [7]. Therefore, we conclude that the location of the CoM can be a key factor in defining limb posture and kinematics. It has been proposed that the relative mass of the CFL can be used as a proxy to estimate the relative importance of femoral retraction during locomotion in extinct bipedal dinosaurs [8]. Our data show that for a given CFL mass, femoral retraction can be greatly affected by the location of the CoM and limb postures. Furthermore, limb retraction can be markedly modulated with speed [5], suggesting caution when using simple morphological parameters to estimate functional relationships. Differences in limb orientation can produce substantial differences in loading regimes on limb bones. The orientation of each limb element to the ground reaction force (GRF) indicates the relative contribution of axial and bending forces to external bone loading: a bone perpendicular to the GRF is expected experience greater bending forces than one parallel to the GRF. Because bone adapts to its loading environment [19], [20], [21], geometric information from limb bones, such as lengths and cross-sectional geometry, are expected to reflect differences in loading regimes and consequently in behavior and locomotor patterns [22], [23]. In this framework, scaling differences in femoral geometry between non-avian theropods and birds have been suggested to be the result of postural differences between these groups [6], [23]. Birds have relatively shorter, stouter femora than non-avian theropods, presumed to be associated with more horizontal orientation. Experimental manipulations of femoral orientation in chickens suggest that torsional loads increase as the femur becomes more horizontal [7] supporting the idea that postural differences could be reflected in differences in limb cross-sectional geometry. To test if the postural differences observed in this study produced changes in limb morphology, we measured the length and mid-shaft cross-sectional properties of the femur in all our individuals. However, we found no differences in cross-sectional femoral geometry among groups. Maybe this is not surprising considering that a recent study analyzing the relationship between posture and femur cross-sectional properties failed to find differences between birds and non-avian theropods [24], suggesting that simple morphological correlates of limb posture should be used with caution. Interestingly, femur length tended to be greater in the experimental group than in both the control-weight and the control group (by 4 and 7%, respectively), although not signifcant. Longer limbs are expected to experience larger bending and torsional moments, so the fact that experimental animals had longer femora suggests that limb verticalization reduces these moments by orienting the bone more parallel to the GRF line of action. If this were the case, it would support the idea that non-avian theropods have relatively thinner femora than extant birds because of postural differences [6]. The present study was inspired by Carrano & Biewener [7] but our results differed markedly from theirs. We suggest that the different outcomes are due to the distinct rearing and exercising conditions used in each study, in addition to the different artificial tails used. First, our experimental subjects lived in a large enclosure under conditions that allowed them to exercise all day long. In Carrano & Biewener's study, experimental chickens were housed individually in smaller cages and were only allowed to exercise 20 minutes per day, 3 days per week, from the 6th to the 12th week. Second, in their study, a lead mass was attached at the distal end of the experimental tail, probably generating excessive displacement of the CoM. During avian evolution, the loss of the CFL and reorganization of the pelvic musculature [5], [13] could have made birds unable to properly carry a postacetabular mass equivalent to that carried by non-avian theropods [5], [6]. In our experimental setup, we attempted to more closely mimic non-avian theropod tail morphology, in which mass is distributed through a distally tapering tail. In addition, we reduced the total tail mass to 15% body mass from the 20% body mass used by Carrano and Biewener. Thus, our study seems to have generated a more gradual and less pronounced change in the moment of inertia produced by the artificial tail, allowing experimental subjects to adjust to the posterior mass by adopting a more vertical position of the femur while standing. Interestingly, the femur kinematics during walking in our control-weight group resembles the results reported in the experimental subjects of Carrano and Biewener. This suggests that their results could be partially explained as a response to the increased loading rather than to the displacement of the CoM. Due to the phylogenetic relatedness, extant birds have been used to inform functional aspects of non-avian dinosaur locomotion. However, substantial differences in hindlimb morphology between these groups make difficult to assess the validity of inferences obtained from such studies. It has even been proposed that, due to functional convergence, mammals might be a better system to study bipedal dinosaur locomotion [7], [23], but the results reported here show that important aspects of non-avian theropod locomotion can be experimentally recreated in modern birds. One caveat, however, is that our approach uses tail reduction as the mechanism for CoM displacement despite it has been recently shown that the evolutionary change in CoM position was driven instead by forelimb enlargement [8]. Nonetheless, this does not mean that tail reduction had no effect on CoM displacement, but that it was not the most important factor. Ideally we would have increased tail mass and reduced pectoral limb mass but, unfortunately, this is not experimentally feasible. We argue that our experimental approach, although not perfect, was effective in displacing the CoM and recreating locomotor patterns expected in non-avian theropods. Thus, we expect that careful phenotypic manipulation of extant birds can open new avenues of experimental investigation into unexplored facets of dinosaur locomotor mechanics and energetics, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between form and function in dinosaur evolution.", "human1": "This discussion summarizes the results of an experiment in which an artificial tail was affixed to birds' bodies in order to study possible ways in which bipedal non-avian dinosaurs may have walked, finding that the location of the CoM may be a key factor in defining limb posture and kinematics."}, "GUM_academic_thrones": {"fulltext": "Re(a)d Wedding: A Comparative Discourse Analysis of Fan Responses to Game of Thrones It is no exaggeration to say that HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones is more than just a television series or a successful brand: it is a transmedia system in the sense first used by Marsha Kinder (1991) and popularized by Henry Jenkins (2006), in which media-hopping networks of intertextualities extend the \u201cstoryworld\u201d of an original production. Now spanning six seasons and 60 episodes, with an average global viewership (from its most recent season) of 25.1 million viewers per episode (Shepherd, 2016), it has spawned five video games, a graphic novel adaptation, several companion books, two rap albums, a 28-city orchestral tour, a wide variety of tabletop games, toys, merchandise and mobile apps, and countless podcasts, fanfics and other fan-based creations. Given the volume of content this represents, it is easy to forget that the television series itself is an adaptation of a book series with a pre-existing fandom. As such, the Game of Thrones storyworld represents a remarkably rich and challenging environment for fans old and new, who must negotiate an increasingly complex network of paratexts and intertexts in order to fully engage with its narratives. In this sense, fans of the series represent an emerging model for cultural consumption that should be carefully explored. Transmedia systems, like that exemplified by Game of Thrones, are becoming increasingly prevalent (e.g., Star Wars, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, etc); these systems demonstrate, in microcosm, the global challenge of managing the fire-hose flow of information in contemporary postdigital society. The study of how people, as fans, access and manage information within a transmedia system provides valuable insight that contributes not only to practitioners and scholars of the media industry, but to the wider context of cultural studies, by offering findings on this new model of the fan as consumer and information-user. For us, as digital humanists, defining the \u201ctransmedia fan\u201d is of particular relevance as we seek to understand contemporary social and cultural transformations engendered by digital technologies. Methodology As a first step in defining the \u201ctransmedia fan\u201d, the current project undertakes a comparative discourse analysis of online conversations of Game of Thrones fans. One of the most dramatic plot developments in the source material (Martin, 2000) was adapted to the screen in the penultimate episode of the third season, \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d (Benioff & Weiss, 2013). Readers of the book series had long anticipated and dreaded the events of the \u201cRed Wedding\u201d, while fans of the show unfamiliar with Martin\u2019s narrative were largely taken unawares by the pivotal episode. Since the television series\u2019 inception, writers at The AV Club have written two critical reviews for each episode: one for viewers familiar with the books (i.e., \u201cExperts\u201d) and one for viewers unfamiliar with the books and averse to \u201cspoilers\u201d (i.e., \u201cNewbies\u201d). What results are two completely separate reviews of \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d which in turn document the fans\u2019 reactions to the episode in the form of user comment threads: one comment thread where fans were expected to be shocked by the outcome of the episode and one comment thread where fans had hotly anticipated it. As a pilot project, the current work takes the content of both comment threads \u2014 a corpus of approximately 5,600 comments \u2014 and analyzes each thread separately using a qualitative coding method aligned with constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006). Through this analysis, a categorization of themes emerges illustrating tactics for negotiating intertexts and paratexts unique to each group of fans. These themes fall under two broad categories: negotiation (i.e., emotional responses) and tactical negotiation (i.e., cognitive, or reasoned responses). A comparison of categories and sub-categories between both groups provides preliminary findings to support an emergent model, or models, of the \u201ctransmedia fan\u201d. Conclusion The present research represents a first step in exploring the impact of transmedia systems, as exemplified by Game of Thrones, through the study of fans. The question posed by this research is, fundamentally, an examination of how the problem of \u201caccess\u201d is framed in postdigital society from the perspective of the consumer. Future research should explore the negotiation tactics observed in transmedia fans using the principles of De Certeau\u2019s (1984) everyday life practice, in order to extend its application to the broader context of modern-day consumers. The current study will contribute to the development of further qualitative and quantitative research that will more clearly define the information behaviors of the transmedia fan. This project is of relevance to researchers in media studies, fan studies, information studies and digital humanities.", "human1": "This paper studies the responses of viewers of the series Game of Thrones to its pivotal third season episode, \u201cThe Rains of Castamere\u201d, comparing online threads by viewers familiar with the plot from the books on which the series is based with those of new fans who had not read the books."}, "GUM_bio_bernoulli": {"fulltext": "Daniel Bernoulli Daniel Bernoulli FRS (German pronunciation: [b\u025b\u0281\u02c8n\u028ali]; 8 February 1700 \u2013 17 March 1782) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. He is particularly remembered for his applications of mathematics to mechanics, especially fluid mechanics, and for his pioneering work in probability and statistics. His name is commemorated in the Bernoulli's principle, a particular example of the conservation of energy, which describes the mathematics of the mechanism underlying the operation of two important technologies of the 20th century: the carburetor and the airplane wing. Daniel Bernoulli Early life Frontpage of Hydrodynamica (1738) Daniel Bernoulli was born in Groningen, in the Netherlands, into a family of distinguished mathematicians. The Bernoulli family came originally from Antwerp, at that time in the Spanish Netherlands, but emigrated to escape the Spanish persecution of the Huguenots. After a brief period in Frankfurt the family moved to Basel, in Switzerland. Daniel was a son of Johann Bernoulli (one of the \"early developers\" of calculus) and a nephew of Jacob Bernoulli (who\" was the first to discover the theory of probability\"). He had two brothers, Niklaus and Johann II. Daniel Bernoulli was described by W. W. Rouse Ball as \"by far the ablest of the younger Bernoullis\". He is said to have had a bad relationship with his father. Upon both of them entering and tying for first place in a scientific contest at the University of Paris, Johann, unable to bear the \"shame\" of being compared Daniel's equal, banned Daniel from his house. Johann Bernoulli also plagiarized some key ideas from Daniel's book Hydrodynamica in his own book Hydraulica which he backdated to before Hydrodynamica. Despite Daniel's attempts at reconciliation, his father carried the grudge until his death. Around schooling age, his father, Johann, encouraged him to study business, there being poor rewards awaiting a mathematician. However, Daniel refused, because he wanted to study mathematics. He later gave in to his father's wish and studied business. His father then asked him to study in medicine, and Daniel agreed under the condition that his father would teach him mathematics privately, which they continued for some time. Daniel studied medicine at Basel, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg, and earned a PhD in anatomy and botany in 1721. He was a contemporary and close friend of Leonhard Euler. He went to St. Petersburg in 1724 as professor of mathematics, but was very unhappy there, and a temporary illness in 1733 gave him an excuse for leaving St. Petersburg. He returned to the University of Basel, where he successively held the chairs of medicine, metaphysics, and natural philosophy until his death. In May, 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Mathematical work His earliest mathematical work was the Exercitationes (Mathematical Exercises), published in 1724 with the help of Goldbach. Two years later he pointed out for the first time the frequent desirability of resolving a compound motion into motions of translation and motion of rotation. His chief work is Hydrodynamica, published in 1738; it resembles Joseph Louis Lagrange's M\u00e9canique Analytique in being arranged so that all the results are consequences of a single principle, namely, conservation of energy. This was followed by a memoir on the theory of the tides, to which, conjointly with the memoirs by Euler and Colin Maclaurin, a prize was awarded by the French Academy: these three memoirs contain all that was done on this subject between the publication of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and the investigations of Pierre-Simon Laplace. Bernoulli also wrote a large number of papers on various mechanical questions, especially on problems connected with vibrating strings, and the solutions given by Brook Taylor and by Jean le Rond d'Alembert. Together Bernoulli and Euler tried to discover more about the flow of fluids. In particular, they wanted to know about the relationship between the speed at which blood flows and its pressure. To investigate this, Daniel experimented by puncturing the wall of a pipe with a small open ended straw and noted that the height to which the fluid rose up the straw was related to fluid's pressure in the pipe. Soon physicians all over Europe were measuring patients' blood pressure by sticking point-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries. It was not until about 170 years later, in 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered a less painful method which is still in use today. However, Bernoulli's method of measuring pressure is still used today in modern aircraft to measure the speed of the air passing the plane; that is its air speed. Taking his discoveries further, Daniel Bernoulli now returned to his earlier work on Conservation of Energy. It was known that a moving body exchanges its kinetic energy for potential energy when it gains height. Daniel realised that in a similar way, a moving fluid exchanges its kinetic energy for pressure. Mathematically this law is now written: \u00bd \u03c1 u 2 + P A consequence of this law is that if the velocity increases then the pressure falls. This is exploited by the wing of an aeroplane which is designed to create an area above its surface where the air velocity increases. The pressure in this area is lower than that under the wing, so the wing is pushed upwards by the relatively higher pressure under the wing.", "human1": "Daniel Bernoulli was an 18th Century Swiss mathematician who taught as a professor in St. Petersburg and Basel, known for his book Hydrodynamica and the invention of a now obsolete method to measure blood pressure using glass tubes to puncture arteries."}, "GUM_bio_byron": {"fulltext": "Education and early loves Byron received his early formal education at Aberdeen Grammar School, and in August 1799 entered the school of Dr. William Glennie, in Dulwich. [17] Placed under the care of a Dr. Bailey, he was encouraged to exercise in moderation but not restrain himself from \"violent\" bouts in an attempt to overcompensate for his deformed foot. His mother interfered with his studies, often withdrawing him from school, with the result that he lacked discipline and his classical studies were neglected. In 1801, he was sent to Harrow, where he remained until July 1805. [6] An undistinguished student and an unskilled cricketer, he did represent the school during the very first Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in 1805. [19] His lack of moderation was not restricted to physical exercise. Byron fell in love with Mary Chaworth, whom he met while at school, [6] and she was the reason he refused to return to Harrow in September 1803. His mother wrote, \"He has no indisposition that I know of but love, desperate love, the worst of all maladies in my opinion. In short, the boy is distractedly in love with Miss Chaworth.\" [6] In Byron's later memoirs, \"Mary Chaworth is portrayed as the first object of his adult sexual feelings.\" [20] Byron finally returned in January 1804, [6] to a more settled period which saw the formation of a circle of emotional involvements with other Harrow boys, which he recalled with great vividness: \"My school friendships were with me passions (for I was always violent).\" [21] The most enduring of those was with John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare \u2014 four years Byron's junior \u2014 whom he was to meet unexpectedly many years later in Italy (1821). [22] His nostalgic poems about his Harrow friendships, Childish Recollections (1806), express a prescient \"consciousness of sexual differences that may in the end make England untenable to him.\" [23] Letters to Byron in the John Murray archive contain evidence of a previously unremarked if short-lived romantic relationship with a younger boy at Harrow, John Thomas Claridge. John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare Ah! Sure some stronger impulse vibrates here, Which whispers friendship will be doubly dear To one, who thus for kindred hearts must roam, And seek abroad, the love denied at home. The following autumn, he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, [24] where he met and formed a close friendship with the younger John Edleston. About his \"prot\u00e9g\u00e9\" he wrote, \"He has been my almost constant associate since October, 1805, when I entered Trinity College. His voice first attracted my attention, his countenance fixed it, and his manners attached me to him for ever.\" In his memory Byron composed Thyrza, a series of elegies. [25] In later years, he described the affair as \"a violent, though pure love and passion\". This statement, however, needs to be read in the context of hardening public attitudes toward homosexuality in England and the severe sanctions (including public hanging) against convicted or even suspected offenders. [26] The liaison, on the other hand, may well have been \"pure\" out of respect for Edleston's innocence, in contrast to the (probably) more sexually overt relations experienced at Harrow School. [27] Byron spent three years at Trinity College, engaging in sexual escapades, boxing, horse riding and gambling. [28] Also while at Cambridge he formed lifelong friendships with men such as John Cam Hobhouse, who initiated him into the Cambridge Whig Club, which endorsed liberal politics, [28] and Francis Hodgson, a Fellow at King's College, with whom he corresponded on literary and other matters until the end of his life.", "human1": "Some details of Lord Byron's early life including his education at Aberdeen Grammar School, Harrow and Trinity College, as well as his romantic involvements and friendships with Mary Chaworth, John FitzGibbon and John Edleston."}, "GUM_bio_chao": {"fulltext": "Early life Born in Tianjin with ancestry in Changzhou, Jiangsu province, Chao went to the United States with a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship in 1910 to study mathematics and physics at Cornell University, where he was a classmate and lifelong friend of Hu Shih, the leader of the New Culture Movement. He then became interested in philosophy, and earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in 1918 with a dissertation entitled \"Continuity: Study in Methodology\". Already in college his interests had turned to music and languages. He spoke German and French fluently and some Japanese, and he had a reading knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin. He served as Bertrand Russell's interpreter when Russell visited China in 1920. In his My Linguistic Autobiography, he wrote of his ability to pick up a Chinese dialect quickly, without much effort. Chao possessed a natural gift for hearing fine distinctions in pronunciation that was said to be \"legendary for its acuity\", enabling him to record the sounds of various dialects with a high degree of accuracy. Career development and later life He returned to China in 1920, marrying the physician Yang Buwei there that year. The ceremony was simple, rather than the noisy traditional wedding, attended only by Hu Shih and one other friend. Hu's account of it in the newspapers made the couple a model of modern marriage for China's New Culture generation. Chao taught mathematics at Tsinghua University and, one year later, returned to the United States to teach at Harvard. He again returned to China in 1925, teaching at Tsinghua, and beginning a survey of the Wu dialects in 1926. He began to conduct linguistic fieldwork throughout China for the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica from 1928 onwards. During this period of time, he collaborated with Luo Changpei and Li Fang-Kuei, the other two leading Chinese linguists of his generation, to edit and render into Chinese Bernhard Karlgren's monumental Etudes sur la Phonologie Chinoise (published in 1940). He left for the US in 1938, and resided there afterwards.

He later expanded his pretense by claiming to be \"Protector of Mexico\" as well. Born in England, Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa. After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, he sailed west, arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849. Norton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice. After he lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, Norton's public prominence faded. He reemerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States. He had no political power, and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him; nevertheless, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented. Though some considered him insane or eccentric, citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations, such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge connecting San Francisco to Oakland, and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay. Long after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge \"The Emperor Norton Bridge\". On January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont (now Grant) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment.

On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself \"Emperor of these United States\": At the peremptory request and desire of a large majority of the citizens of these United States, I, Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape of Good Hope, and now for the last 9 years and 10 months past of S.

The announcement was first reprinted for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Bulletin. Norton would later add \"Protector of Mexico\" to this title. Thus commenced his unprecedented and whimsical 21-year \"reign\" over America. One of Norton's undated proclamations In his self-appointed role of emperor, Norton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state. After assuming absolute control over the country, he saw no further need for a legislature, and on October 12, 1859, he issued a decree formally abolishing the United States Congress. In it, Norton observed: ... fraud and corruption prevent a fair and proper expression of the public voice; that open violation of the laws are constantly occurring, caused by mobs, parties, factions and undue influence of political sects; that the citizen has not that protection of person and property which he is entitled. Norton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to \"remedy the evil complained of\". In an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress: WHEREAS, a body of men calling themselves the National Congress are now in session in Washington City, in violation of our Imperial edict of the 12th of October last, declaring the said Congress abolished; WHEREAS, it is necessary for the repose of our Empire that the said decree should be strictly complied with; NOW, THEREFORE, we do hereby Order and Direct Major-General Scott, the Command-in-Chief of our Armies, immediately upon receipt of this, our Decree, to proceed with a suitable force and clear the Halls of Congress.", "human1": "Joshua Norton was an eccentric resident of San Francisco who proclaimed himself Emperor of the United States in the second half of the 19th Century, and came to be known as Emperor Norton."}, "GUM_bio_enfant": {"fulltext": "Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Pierre Charles L'Enfant (French: [pj\u025b\u0281 \u0283\u0251\u0281l l\u0251\u0303f\u0251\u0303]; August 2, 1754 \u2013 June 14, 1825), self-identified as Peter Charles L'Enfant while living in the United States, was a French-born American military engineer who designed the basic plan for Washington, D.C. (capital city of the U.S.) known today as the L'Enfant Plan (1791). Early life and education L'Enfant was born in Paris, France on August 2, 1754, the third child and second son of Pierre L'Enfant (1704 \u2013 1787), a painter with a good reputation in the service of King Louis XV of France, (1710 - 1774, reigned 1715 - 1774), and Marie L'Enfant, the daughter of a minor official at court. In 1758, his brother Pierre Joseph died at the age of six, and Pierre Charles became the eldest son. He studied art at the Royal Academy in the Louvre, as well as with his father at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He left school in France to enlist in the American Revolutionary War on the side of the rebelling colonials. Military service L'Enfant was recruited by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais to serve in the American Revolutionary War in the United States. He arrived in 1777 at the age of 23, and served as a military engineer in the Continental Army with Major General Lafayette. He was commissioned as a captain in the Corps of Engineers on April 3, 1779 to rank from February 18, 1778. Despite his aristocratic origins, L'Enfant closely identified with the United States, changing his first name from Pierre to Peter when he first came to the rebelling colonies in 1777. L'Enfant served on General George Washington's staff at Valley Forge. While there, the Marquis de Lafayette commissioned L'Enfant to paint a portrait of Washington. He was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779. He recovered and became a prisoner of war at surrender of Charleston, South Carolina on May 12, 1780. He was exchanged in November 1780 and served on General George Washington's staff for the remainder of the American Revolution. L'Enfant was promoted by brevet to Major in the Corps of Engineers on May 2, 1783, in recognition of his service to the cause of American liberty. He was discharged when the Continental Army was disbanded in December 1783. After the war, L'Enfant designed the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former officers of the Continental Army, shaped as an eagle, at the request of Washington. He was sent to France to have insignias made for members of the Society, a group of veterans of the war. Career Post\u2013Revolutionary War Following the American Revolutionary War, L'Enfant established a successful and highly profitable civil engineering firm in New York City. He achieved some fame as an architect by redesigning the City Hall in New York for the First Congress of the United States (See: Federal Hall). He also designed furniture and houses for the wealthy as well as coins and medals, including the insignia of the Society of the Cincinnati. He was also a friend of Alexander Hamilton, and some of their correspondances from 1790 to 1801 now reside in the National Archives. While L'Enfant was in New York City, he was initiated into Freemasonry. His initiation took place on April 17, 1789, at Holland Lodge No. 8, F&AM, which the Grand Lodge of New York F&AM had chartered in 1787. L'Enfant took only the first of three degrees offered by the Lodge and did not progress further in Freemasonry.", "human1": "Pierre Charles L'Enfant was a French-born American revolutionary who served in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War followed by a career in civil engineering which included redesigning New York's city hall and designing the basic plan for Washington, D.C.

Fillmore (August 9, 1929 \u2013 February 13, 2014) was an American linguist and Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan in 1961. Fillmore spent ten years at The Ohio State University and a year as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University before joining Berkeley's Department of Linguistics in 1971. [1] Fillmore was extremely influential in the areas of syntax and lexical semantics. A three\u2013day conference was held at UC Berkeley in celebration of his 80th birthday in 2009. [2] Fillmore received the 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Computational Linguistics. [3] He died in 2014. [4] Early years Fillmore spent three years in the U.S. Army stationed in Japan, where he intercepted coded Russian conversations on short-wave radio and taught himself Japanese. [2] Following his discharge, he taught English at a Buddhist girls' school while also taking classes at Kyoto University. He returned to the US, receiving his doctorate at the University of Michigan and then teaching at The Ohio State University in Columbus. At the time, he was still a proponent of Noam Chomsky's theory of generative grammar during its earliest transformational grammar phase. In 1963, his seminal article The position of embedding transformations in a Grammar introduced the transformational cycle. The central idea is to first apply rules to the smallest applicable unit, then to the smallest unit containing that one, and so on. [5] This principle has been a foundational insight for theories of syntax since that time. Cognitive linguistics By 1965, Fillmore had come to acknowledge that semantics plays a crucial role in grammar. [6] In 1968, he published his theory of Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968), which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants. An action can have an agent, a patient, purposes, locations, and so on. These participants were called \"cases\" in his original paper, but later came to be known as semantic roles or thematic relations, which are similar to theta roles in generative grammar. Following his move to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971, this theory eventually evolved into a broader cognitive linguistic theory called Frame Semantics (1976). A commercial event, for instance, crucially involved elements such as a seller, a buyer, some good, and some money. In language, such an event can be expressed in a variety of different ways, e.g. using the verb 'to sell' or the verb 'to buy'. According to frame semantics, meaning is best studied in terms of the mental concepts and participants in the minds of the speaker and addressee. Around the same time, Fillmore's Santa Cruz Lectures on Deixis, delivered in 1971 and published in 1975, contributed to establishing the field of linguistic pragmatics, which studies the relationship between linguistic form and the context of utterance. [7] [8] In all of this research, he illuminated the fundamental importance of semantics, and its role in motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena. His collaboration with Paul Kay and George Lakoff was generalized into the theory of Construction Grammar. This work aimed at developing a complete theory of grammar that would fully acknowledge the role of semantics right from the start, while simultaneously adopting constraint-based formalisms as popular in computer science and natural language processing. This theory built on the notion of construction from traditional and pedagogical grammars rather than the rule-based formalisms that dominate most of generative grammar. One of Fillmore's most widely noticed works of the time (with Paul Kay and Cathy O'Connor) appeared in 'Language' in 1988 as \"Regularity and Idiomaticity in Grammatical Constructions: The Case of Let Alone\". Their paper highlighted the merits of such a theory of by focusing on the 'let alone' construction. Over time, construction grammar developed into a research area of its own, and a number of variants have been proposed over the years by different researchers. Fillmore is now widely recognized as one of the founders of cognitive linguistics. The first chapter of \u201cCognitive Linguistics\u201d by Cruse and Croft (2004), for instance, begins with a summary of Fillmore's work. Fillmore served as President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1991 and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2000. [7] His legacy continues with his many notable students, including Adele Goldberg, Laura Michaelis, Christopher Johnson, Miriam R. L. Petruck, Len Talmy, and Eve Sweetser. FrameNet In the 1990s, Fillmore taught classes in computational lexicography at the University of Pisa, where he met Sue Atkins, who was conducting frame-semantic analyses from a lexicographic perspective. In their subsequent discussions and collaborations, Fillmore came to acknowledge the importance of considering corpus data. [2] They discussed the \"dictionary of the future\", in which every word would be linked to example sentences from corpora. [7] [9] After 23 years at the University of California, Berkeley, Fillmore retired in 1994 and joined Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. [6] There, he started a project called FrameNet, an on-line structured description of the English lexicon implementing much of what he had earlier proposed more theoretically in his theory of Frame semantics, while implementing the idea of emphasizing example sentences from corpora. In FrameNet, words are described in terms of the frames they evoke. Data is gathered from the British National Corpus, annotated for semantic and syntactic relations, and stored in a database organized by both lexical items and Frames.", "human1": "Charles J.

Galois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. [4] [7] Sim\u00e9on Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\" [16] While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832, [12] after which he was somehow talked into a duel. [8] Galois' fatal duel took place on 30 May. [17] The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it. What is known is that five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair. [7] Some archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was a Mademoiselle St\u00e9phanie-F\u00e9licie Poterin du Motel, [18] the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. [19] The letters hint that Mlle. du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fianc\u00e9, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself famously exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\" [12] Much more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy. [14] As to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, [13] who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest. [20] However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel's \"supposed fianc\u00e9\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L. D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. [21] Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history. Whatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. [22] Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, \"This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.\" However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. [7] In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.

He died the following morning [17] at ten o'clock in the H\u00f4pital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots. [17] There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death, and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois' death. [23] He was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were: \u201cNe pleure pas, Alfred!

He was descended from a family of Aberdeenshire, holders of the small estate of Auchleuchries, near Ellon. The family was connected with the noble branch of Haddo. As a result of his distinguished service for Sweden, Poland and Russia he rose in ranks from trooper to full general, and became principal advisor and close friend of Tsar Peter the Great. Gordon assumed the additional Christian name of Leopold when confirmed as a Roman Catholic shortly before his death. Life Gordon was brought up and remained a lifelong Roman Catholic, at a time when the Church was being persecuted in Scotland, which had become Calvinist. After an education at the parish schools of Cruden and Ellon, at age of fifteen he entered the Jesuit college at Braunsberg, East Prussia, then part of Poland; however, his character did not tolerate well the strict and sombre way of life at the school, and he soon decided to return home. He changed his mind, however, before re-embarking on the journey back to Scotland, and after journeying on foot in several parts of what is today Germany, in 1655 he enlisted at Hamburg into the military service of Sweden. In the course of the next five years he served alternately for Poland and Sweden and was taken prisoner by both. At the Battle of Chudnov in 1660, Gordon was wounded. [1] Upon hearing of the Stuart restoration, Gordon left the Polish service, but found himself unable to obtain military employment in Scotland or England. [1] In 1661, after further experiences as a soldier of fortune, he joined the Russian army under Tsar Aleksei I, and in 1665 was sent on a special mission to England. After his return he distinguished himself in several wars against the Turks and Tatars in southern Russia. Gordon disliked the Russian service, complaining of the corruption and venality of Russian officials, which left him, in his own words, \"almost at wits end with vexation\". [2] However, in recognition of his service he was promoted to major-general in 1678, was appointed to the high command at Kiev in 1679, and in 1683 was made lieutenant-general. He was not the only Scottish soldier in the Tsar's service; his fellow-Scots Paul Menzies and Alexander Livingston also found themselves in Russia fleeing religious intolerance or seeking adventure. Gordon visited England and Scotland in 1686. In 1687 and 1689 he took part in expeditions against the Tatars in the Crimea, being made a full general. Later in 1689 a revolution broke out in Moscow, and with the troops under his command Gordon virtually decided events in favour of Peter the Great, [3] and against the Regent, Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. Consequently, he was for the remainder of his life in high favour with the Tsar, who confided to him the command of his capital during his absence from Russia. In 1696, Gordon's design of a \"moveable rampart\" played a key role in helping the Russians take Azov. [3] Gordon's alleged tomb at Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow. One of Gordon's greatest achievements was securing permission from the Tsars to establish the first Roman Catholic church and school in Muscovy, of which he remained the main benefactor, and headed the Catholic community in Russia until his death. For his services his second son James, brigadier of the Russian army, was created Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1701. The Tsar employed him in organizing his army according to the West European system; and raised him to the rank of full general. At the end of his life the Tsar, who had visited Gordon frequently during his illness, was with him when he died, and with his own hands closed his eyes. Originally buried in the Foreign Quarter, his remains were reinterred at Azov in 1877, with an inscription in German which mistakenly gives his rank as Oberst, Colonel. General Gordon left behind him a uniquely detailed diary of his life and times, written in English. This is preserved in manuscript in the Russian State Military Archive in Moscow.

Specializing in short stories, she was one of the first important writers to appear in the Meiji period (1868 - 1912) and Japan's first prominent woman writer of modern times. She wrote relatively little as a result of living a brief life \u2014 she died at 24 \u2014 but her stories had a large impact on Japanese literature and she is still appreciated by the Japanese public today. Efforts to become a writer She, her mother, and younger sister made ends meet by doing needlework, washing, and other jobs. In 1892, after seeing the success of a classmate, Kaho Tanabe, who wrote a novel, Higuchi decided to become a novelist to support her family. Nevertheless, her initial efforts at writing fiction were in the form of a short story, a form to which she would remain true. In 1891 she met her future advisor who would help, she assumed, this poet-turned-fiction-writer and connect her with editors: Tosui Nakarai. She fell in love with him right away, not knowing that, at 31, he had a reputation as a womanizer. Nor did she realize that he wrote popular literature which aimed to please the general public and in no way wished to be associated with serious literature. Her mentor did not return her passionate, if discreet, love for him, and instead treated her as a younger sister. This failed relationship would become a recurrent theme in Higuchi's fiction. Eventually, she got the break she was so eager for: her first stories were published in a minor newspaper under her pen name, Ichiyo Higuchi. The stories from this first period (1892 \u2013 94) suffered from the excessive influence of Heian poetry. Higuchi felt compelled to demonstrate her classical literary training. The plots were thin, there was little development of character and they were loaded down by excessive sentiment, especially when compared to what she was writing concurrently in her diary. But she was developing rapidly. Several of her trademark themes appear; for example, the triangular relationship among a lonely, beautiful, young woman who has lost her parents, a handsome man who has abandoned her (and remains in the background), and a lonely and desperate ragamuffin who falls in love with her. Another theme Higuchi repeated was the ambition and cruelty of the Meiji middle class. The story \"Umoregi\" (\"In Obscurity\") signaled Higuchi's arrival as a professional writer. It was published in the prestigious journal Miyako no Hana in 1892, only nine months after she had started writing in earnest. Her work was noticed and she was recognized as a promising new author. Her last years In 1893, Higuchi, her mother and her sister abandoned their middle class house and, with a grim determination to survive, moved to a poor neighborhood where they opened a stationery store that before long failed. Their new dwelling was a five-minute walk from Tokyo's ill-famed red-light district, the Yoshiwara. Her experience living in this neighborhood would provide material for several of her later stories, especially \"Takekurabe\", (literally,\" Comparing heights\"; \"Child's Play\" in the Robert Lyons Danly translation; also called \"Growing Up\" in the Edward Seidensticker translation.) The stories of her mature period (1894 \u2013 96) were not only marked by her experience living near the red-light district and greater concern over the plight of women, but also by the influence of Ihara Saikaku, a 17th-century writer, whose stories she had recently discovered. His distinctiveness lay in great part in his acceptance of low-life characters as worthwhile literary subjects. What Higuchi added was a special awareness of suffering and sensitivity. To this period belong \"\u014ctsugomori\" (\"On the Last Day of the Year\"), \"Nigorie\" (\"Troubled Waters\"), \"Wakare-Michi\" (\"Separate Ways\"), \"J\u016bsan'ya\" (\"The Thirteenth Night\") and \"Takekurabe\" (\"Child's Play\"). The last two are considered her best work. With these last stories her fame spread throughout the Tokyo literary establishment. In her humble home she was visited by other writers, students of poetry, admirers, the curious, critics, and editors requesting her collaboration. But between constant interruptions and frequent headaches, Higuchi stopped writing. As her father and one of her brothers had before her, she had caught tuberculosis. She died on November 23, 1896, at the age of twenty-four. Higuchi's likeness adorns the Japanese 5000 yen banknote as of fall 2004, becoming the third woman to appear on a Japanese banknote, after Empress Jing\u016b in 1881 and Murasaki Shikibu in 2000.

[7] Professional career Minor leagues Holt began his professional career with the Pittsburgh Pirates' short season, Class-A affiliate, the State College Spikes, before advancing to the High-A Bradenton Marauders in 2010. His 2010 season was cut short due to injury to his medial collateral ligament, which required surgery. [8] He began the 2011 season with the Pirates' Double-A affiliate, the Altoona Curve. On July 13, 2011, Holt was named the MVP of the Eastern League All-Star Game after hitting a two-run homer in the ninth inning. [9] Holt opened 2012 with Altoona and later joined Triple-A Indianapolis Indians. He was promoted to the Pittsburgh Pirates from the minors as the major league rosters expanded on September 1. Pittsburgh Pirates (2012) Holt made his Major League debut on September 1, 2012. At the time of his promotion, he had hit a .322 average in 102 games with Altoona and .432 in 24 games for Indianapolis. [10] On September 4, against the Houston Astros, Holt became only the second Pirates player since 1900 to have a four-hit game within his first four career games in the majors. The only other Pirates player to have a four-hit game so early in his career was Jack Merson, who went 4-for-5 in his second major league game on September 15, 1951. [11] In 24 games, Holt batted .292 with a triple and 3 RBI. Boston Red Sox (2013 \u2013 present) 2013 On December 26, 2012 he was traded to the Boston Red Sox (along with Joel Hanrahan) for Jerry Sands, Stolmy Pimentel, Mark Melancon, and Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas, Jr..

Holt received his first championship ring when the Red Sox won the World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals in six games, despite not playing in the postseason. 2014 Holt again started 2014 in Triple-A, but was called up May 17 after an injury to Will Middlebrooks and hit leadoff for the rest of the season. On May 31, 2014, against the Tampa Bay Rays at Fenway Park, Holt hit his first Major League home run. On June 8, 2014, in order to allow Xander Bogaerts to play 3rd base, Holt moved to left field. He immediately impressed, making a sensational catch on the warning track to rob Ian Kinsler of a hit. On July 9, 2014, against the Chicago White Sox, Holt drove in Daniel Nava in the bottom of the 9th inning for the first walk-off hit of his career. [13] On June 1, 2015, while starting at first base for the first time in his career, Holt went 4-for-4 with four doubles, a walk, and two RBI against the Tampa Bay Rays to win 4 to 0.

He was born at Stridon, a village near Emona on the border of Dalmatia and Pannonia. [3] [4] [5] He is best known for his translation of most of the Bible into Latin (the translation that became known as the Vulgate), and his commentaries on the Gospels. His list of writings is extensive. [6] The prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Pope Damasus I, who died in December of 384, Jerome was known for his teachings on Christian moral life, especially to those living in cosmopolitan centers such as Rome. In many cases, he focused his attention on the lives of women and identified how a woman devoted to Jesus should live her life. This focus stemmed from his close patron relationships with several prominent female ascetics who were members of affluent senatorial families. [7] Jerome is recognised as a saint and Doctor of the Church by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Lutheran Church, and the Anglican Communion. [8] His feast day is 30 September. Life Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus was born at Stridon around 347 AD. [9] He was of Illyrian ancestry, [10] although his ability to speak the Illyrian languages causes controversy. He was not baptized until about 360 - 366, when he had gone to Rome with his friend Bonosus of Sardica (who may or may not have been the same Bonosus whom Jerome identifies as his friend who went to live as a hermit on an island in the Adriatic) to pursue rhetorical and philosophical studies. He studied under the grammarian Aelius Donatus. There Jerome learned Latin and at least some Greek, [11] though probably not the familiarity with Greek literature he would later claim to have acquired as a schoolboy. [12] As a student in Rome, Jerome engaged in the superficial escapades and sexual experimentation of students there, which he indulged in quite casually but for which he suffered terrible bouts of guilt afterwards. [13] [better source needed] To appease his conscience, he would visit on Sundays the sepulchres of the martyrs and the Apostles in the catacombs. This experience would remind him of the terrors of hell: Often I would find myself entering those crypts, deep dug in the earth, with their walls on either side lined with the bodies of the dead, where everything was so dark that almost it seemed as though the Psalmist's words were fulfilled, Let them go down quick into Hell. [14] Here and there the light, not entering in through windows, but filtering down from above through shafts, relieved the horror of the darkness. But again, as soon as you found yourself cautiously moving forward, the black night closed around and there came to my mind the line of Vergil, \"Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent\". [15] [16] St. Jerome in His Study (1480), by Domenico Ghirlandaio Jerome used a quote from Virgil \u2014 \"On all sides round horror spread wide; the very silence breathed a terror on my soul\" [17] \u2014 to describe the horror of hell. Jerome initially used classical authors to describe Christian concepts such as hell that indicated both his classical education and his deep shame of their associated practices, such as pederasty which was found in Rome. [citation needed] Conversion to Christianity St Jerome in the Nuremberg Chronicle\" Although initially skeptical of Christianity, he was eventually converted. [18] After several years in Rome, he travelled with Bonosus to Gaul and settled in Trier where he seems to have first taken up theological studies, and where, for his friend Tyrannius Rufinus, he copied Hilary of Poitiers' commentary on the Psalms and the treatise De synodis. Next came a stay of at least several months, or possibly years, with Rufinus at Aquileia, where he made many Christian friends. Some of these accompanied Jerome when about 373, he set out on a journey through Thrace and Asia Minor into northern Syria. At Antioch, where he stayed the longest, two of his companions died and he himself was seriously ill more than once. During one of these illnesses (about the winter of 373 - 374), he had a vision that led him to lay aside his secular studies and devote himself to God. He seems to have abstained for a considerable time from the study of the classics and to have plunged deeply into that of the Bible, under the impulse of Apollinaris of Laodicea, then teaching in Antioch and not yet suspected of heresy. St. Jerome in the Desert, by Giovanni Bellini (1505) Seized with a desire for a life of ascetic penance, Jerome went for a time to the desert of Chalcis, to the southeast of Antioch, known as the \"Syrian Thebaid\", from the number of eremites inhabiting it. During this period, he seems to have found time for studying and writing. He made his first attempt to learn Hebrew under the guidance of a converted Jew; and he seems to have been in correspondence with Jewish Christians in Antioch. Around this time he had copied for him a Hebrew Gospel, of which fragments are preserved in his notes, and is known today as the Gospel of the Hebrews, and which the Nazarenes considered to be the true Gospel of Matthew. [19] Jerome translated parts of this Hebrew Gospel into Greek.

Nida (November 11, 1914 \u2013 August 25, 2011) was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies. Life Nida was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on November 11, 1914. He became a Christian at a young age, when he responded to the altar call at his church \"to accept Christ as my Saviour.\" He graduated summa cum laude from the University of California in 1936. After graduating he attended Camp Wycliffe, where Bible translation theory was taught. He ministered for a short time among the Tarahumara Indians in Chihuahua, Mexico, until health problems due to an inadequate diet and the high altitude forced him to leave. Sometime in this period, Nida became a founding charter member of Wycliffe Bible Translators, a related organization to the Summer Institute of Linguistics. In 1937, Nida undertook studies at the University of Southern California, where he obtained a master's degree in New Testament Greek in 1939. In that same year he became interim pastor of Calvary Church of Santa Ana, California following the resignation of its founding pastor. Despite his conservative background, in later years Nida became increasingly ecumenical and New Evangelical (clarification needed) in his approach. In 1943, Nida received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan. He was ordained as a Baptist minister. He married Althea Lucille Sprague, who died in 1993. In 1997, he married Mar\u00eda Elena Fernandez-Miranda, a lawyer and diplomatic attache. Nida retired in the early 1980s, although he continued to give lectures in universities all around the world, and lived in Alpine, Arizona, USA; Madrid, Spain and Brussels, Belgium. He died in Madrid on August 25, 2011 aged 96. Theories Nida has been a pioneer in the fields of translation theory and linguistics. His Ph.D. dissertation, A Synopsis of English Syntax, was the first full-scale analysis of a major language according to the \"immediate-constituent\" theory. His textbook Morphology: The Descriptive Analysis of Words was one of the major works of American Structuralism. It remained the only thorough introduction to the field for decades and is still valuable for its many examples and exercises. His most notable contribution to translation theory is Dynamic Equivalence, also known as Functional Equivalence. For more information, see \"Dynamic and formal equivalence.\" Nida also developed the componential analysis technique, which split words into their components to help determine equivalence in translation (e.g. \"bachelor\" This is, perhaps, not the best example of the technique, though it is the most well-known. Nida's dynamic-equivalence theory is often held in opposition to the views of philologists who maintain that an understanding of the source text (ST) can be achieved by assessing the inter-animation of words on the page, and that meaning is self-contained within the text (i.e. much more focused on achieving semantic equivalence). This theory, along with other theories of correspondence in translating, are elaborated in his essay Principles of Correspondence, where Nida begins by asserting that given that \"no two languages are identical, either in the meanings given to corresponding symbols or in the ways in which symbols are arranged in phrases and sentences, it stands to reason that there can be no absolute correspondence between languages. Hence, there can be no fully exact translations.\" While the impact of a translation may be close to the original, there can be no identity in detail. Nida then sets forth the differences in translation, as he would account for it, within three basic factors: 1. The nature of the message: in some messages the content is of primary consideration, and in others the form must be given a higher priority. 2. The purpose of the author and of the translator: to give information on both form and content; to aim at full intelligibility of the reader so he / she may understand the full implications of the message; for imperative purposes that aim at not just understanding the translation but also at ensuring no misunderstanding of the translation. 3. The type of audience: prospective audiences differ both in decoding ability and in potential interest. Nida brings in the reminder that while there are no such things as \"identical equivalents\" in translating, what one must in translating seek to do is find the \"closest natural equivalent\". Here he identifies two basic orientations in translating based on two different types of equivalence: Formal Equivalence (F-E) and Dynamic Equivalence (D-E). F-E focuses attention on the message itself, in both form and content. Such translations then would be concerned with such correspondences as poetry to poetry, sentence to sentence, and concept to concept. Such a formal orientation that typifies this type of structural equivalence is called a \"gloss translation\" in which the translator aims at reproducing as literally and meaningfully as possible the form and content of the original. The principles governing an F-E translation would then be: reproduction of grammatical units; consistency in word usage; and meanings in terms of the source context.", "human1": "Eugene Nida was a linguist who developed the dynamic-equivalence Bible-translation theory and one of the founders of the modern discipline of Translation Studies."}, "GUM_bio_padalecki": {"fulltext": "Jared Padalecki Jared Tristan Padalecki (born July 19, 1982) [1] is an American actor.

Icon of St. Theodorus of Tabennese Biography According to hagiography, Theodorus was born into a wealthy Christian family and was well educated from a young age. Early in life he denied the excesses of his parents, and at the age of fourteen joined a monastery in the diocese of Sne, near the modern town of Esna, Egypt. A brother from Theodorus\u2019 monastery stayed with Pachomius in Tabennese while traveling and preached of the virtues of the Koinonia upon his return to Sne. Praying and weeping, Theodorus became determined that his destiny lay with Pachomius. Although initially denied passage to Tabennese by a Pachomian monk due to his wealthy background, Theodorus opted to follow the visiting monk, and his persistence (and lack of obedience) paid off. He was welcomed by Pachomius upon his arrival, and quickly integrated into the community at Tabennese around 328. Quickly becoming a favorite of Pachomius, Theodorus lived an enviably ascetic life in the monastery, and took on the title of the \"brothers\u2019 comforter\". Theodorus asserted his influence openly (which resulted in reprimands from Pachomius) and generally maintained himself as a prominent figure at Tabennese for several years, despite never being given a position of power in the monastic hierarchy. Finally, Pachomius called on him to preach to the brothers despite his youth, and eventually appointed him steward of Tabennese after several new monasteries had been built. Retiring to the monastery of Phbow, Pachomius gave Theodorus complete control over Tabennese, though recalled him from the position after witnessing several monks under Theodorus\u2019 watch violating the monastic rules without reprimand. Having failed to prove his governing ability and once more in a position no higher than when he had entered the monastery, Theodorus became a personal assistant to Pachomius and remained relatively quiet for some years. Despite his clear potential and popularity, Pachomius refused to grant Theodorus any kind of authority; though the old man's failing health soon changed things forever. After Theodorus had been assisting Pachomius at Tabennese for several years following his demotion, Pachomius became very ill and seemed to be on the verge of death. Pachomius had not named a successor, and several brothers pleaded with Theodorus to assert himself as head of the Koinonia when the sickly man died. Despite the assertion that Theodorus apparently did not want the rank of a father or this world's glory, he consented. Unfortunately for the would-be leader, Pachomius recovered, and upon hearing of Theodorus\u2019 decision, exiled the ambitious young man. After living a life of constant weeping and prayer in solitude, Pachomius forgave Theodorus and allowed him to live among the brothers once more. Normalcy returned, though never again would Pachomius fully trust his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9. In 348 Pachomius died, naming the brother Petronios as his successor rather than the clearly qualified Theodorus. The death of Petronios later that year would leave Apa Horsiesios in charge, and the popular Theodorus would retreat to the distant monastery of Phnoum. Although it seems Theodorus practiced complete submission to the new leader of the Koinonia, problems soon arose in several Pachomian monasteries that viewed Horsiesios as a weak leader. Refusing to work or communicate and demanding a new leader, many of the elder monks completely abandoned any notion of obedience to Horsiesios. The federation of monasteries was falling apart, and Theodorus rushed to Tabennese to placate the rebels. Soon after his arrival, Theodorus was the new de facto leader, though he claimed to be only acting on behalf of Horsiesios. For eighteen years Theodorus administered from Pachomius\u2019 old headquarters in Phbow, using techniques far more assertive than his predecessors, such as constantly shuffling the offices and locations of the most ambitious monks. Yet in spite of this somewhat unstable shifting, the Koinonia was ruled peacefully for nearly two decades, at which point Theodorus predicted he would soon die. Within a few months his prediction came true, and Apa Horsiesios once more took his place as the head of the communities in both title and authority.

Alright folks. Well alreet, well alroot, well alright. By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here, but first, I would like to talk to you about these three items. I have here, some ice in a pan, water in this glass, and steam rising from this pot. Now, I would like to ask you, how these three things. Tell me please. How are they all alike. These three things. This ice here in this pan. This water in this glass, and the steam rising from this pot, just yell it out, we are informal here, yes. Correct. They are all forms of water. This ice here of course is water, I told you there was water in this glass, and you have all seen water boil at home, so you are familiar with steam. But now let's try to figure out how they're different, we'll look at temperature, first. And the temperature of this water here, the ice, is, about uh twenty-four \u2013 woo- nineteen degrees. Very cold. The temperature of this w- water here, is sixty-four degrees, the temperature of this steam, is, I know it's hotter than that. Yeah, it's about a hundred and eleven degrees. Okay. Fahrenheit. Okay. Oh, and by the way guys, what do we call something that's hard, like this ice here, or a table, or a rock? We call it a? Solid. Very good. You should g- \u2014 you should be a choir. You should go out on the road there, like, yeah. We are. Y- \u2014 oh well, I'm glad to meet you. Please give me your itinerary after the show. Yes. Yes. Of course we call it a sholids. A solid. And a solid has one shape. The shape that it starts out with. And what do we call something that you \u2014 that you can splish splash? Take a bath in. Anything wet like soda or milk. Liquid. You're not gonna let me finish, are you? Yes, we call it a? Liquid. Very good. And a liquid can change its shape, to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in. And finally, what do we call something that's loose, and floating around like this steam here? Or a cloud, or the air we breathe, we call it a? Gas. Correct. A gas. And a gas completely fills whatever shape container you put it in. And so, how do you get water to change, from a solid, to a liquid, to a gas, and back and forth? Add energy. Woo. I like the way he expressed that. Never before have I heard it, add or subtract energy, or, heat, change the temperature, basically. Correct? Alright. Well folks, now I'm going to show you something else that happens when you change the temperature, and that's where these balloons come in. I have here a number of balloons, but, l- let's see how many of these balloons, I can fit, into this little itty-bitty container here. Well, everybody count together. This would be ... There's a- in there. You think, well, okay, w- th- th-, I'm glad I never saw d- Citizen Kane with you. Rosebud is a sled. Okay. Well, let's all count together folks, that was? One. One. Very good. One balloon going into the little container here. And this would be ... Two. Two. Very good counting there. Two. Excellent. Two balloons going into the little container here. Ah, they're not fitting in so easily. Oh no. So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here. Oh stop guessing at what this is. Let's have some suspense here. Come on. Alright. And this would be? Three. Three. Very good. Three balloons going onto the the little container there. Three balloons. Three, yes, the balloon trinity. And now, this would be? Eight. Four. Four.

In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work. I mean, it \u2014 that's just kinda how it happens, you know, because he kinda has to tell you ... They go over the whole, the whole part of the horse. I mean, all the skeleton part of it you know, and \u2014 and they go through every kinda ligament. And I mean, there's, millions of ligaments, and millions of tendons, you know, well not millions, but, I mean ... Yeah, I bet.

You know, all the way down to the hoof, and then, the bone in the hoof, and, then all the wall, and, you know, of the hoof, and, what everything was called there, and then, he went over on how to trim it, and where you \u2014 Th- there's a white line, that you go by, and a horse has this little white line, and you clean it out with the \u2014 with the hoof knife.

And that's kinda where you go by, to \u2014 You know, the horse kinda helps you out, because it, has that little white line right there. Mhm. And that's where you kinda \u2014 kinda need a little guide, of where you trim. And, I am still scared to do it. Because, you know, I mean, you can make a horse go lame, by doing it. Really? Well you can trim em too short. And make em, you know, and they're just a little bit, for f- the first couple of days, you know, I mean they're just sore. That's not bad, but sometimes you can get it really bad. You can really make a horse really bad.

A lot of times, like, I'll get done, and I'll think I'm done, and I'll look at \u2013 look down at the horse's hoof, and it's still, it's too long.

We did a lot of stuff with the \u2014 like we had the, um, the burners? You know, and you'd put the \u2014 you'd have \u2014 you started out with the straight iron? You know? And you'd stick it into the, into the, you know like, actual blacksmithing. And you'd put it into the hot coals, you know? And then, we'd \u2014 I I \u2013 straight bar. And we'd make it a \u2014 a horseshoe out of it, you know? But, these shoes we never did put on a horse. We just put the shoes that were already made, on a horse. And that's as far as we got.

Th- \u2013 yeah. Farrier is what they're called. And the m- \u2014 the reason they were showing us this at college, was just, to get us, to know if our trimmer, and shoer was doing it right, and \u2014 plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments. Which we, we had it in another class too. We \u2014 that was kind of a double thing that, we had in \u2014 in another class, so it was kinda review for us. Well it was a review for some people, depending on what time of the year you took it. You know. If it was a review or not. But, anyway, um, what was I gonna say? I forgot what I was think- \u2014 You said you never made the horseshoes. Gonna say. But. Well, w- um, when we put em on a horse's hoof, all we do, they're already made. They're round.

Uh, upon a reve- uh \u2014 uh receiving my check, uh, for about two and a half weeks of work, approximately between fifty and seventy hours, I was paid three-hundred and sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents.

Uh Mitchell expressed a desire to do the work out there, he expressed, he did not know how to handle the payroll. Most of the, uh, contractors here in town, that are independents like Mitchell, don't know how to do prevailing wage statements. The college is a state-funded uh uh remodel, and on state-funded remodels, we're required to pay prevailing wages. Uh prevailing wages, that, um, that indicate different levels of agility, of the different men working. And so, uh a lot of the crews, uh, like Mitchell, who have people that work under him, around town, in regular situations, come to the people like me, and ask us to do payroll for them. When we do the payroll for them, we state to them up front, that uh, we will pay the payroll, we will make the deductions, and then the employer contribution, which is approximately twenty-six percent, over and above the hourly wage, is also deducted, from the um subcontractor's check. Now this uh th- twenty-six percent, that'd be be social security. And what else would it include? Um \u2014 Sorta like, um \u2014 That's anything above that.

Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate. And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus. You alone, among all the others, have recognized the key question. And you do not bore me, with the Papacy, purgatory, indulgences, and similar nonsense. You, and you alone, have identified that on which all else hinges. And you have put the razor to the throat. And for that I thank you heartily. Um, thus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject. And Erasmus commented on the significance of their engagement, in battle, in his own style. And he wrote to Luther.

I don't think that he would acknowledge original sin. Is based uh, alright, what is it, it's based, as it is, on the concept, that human nature is totally depraved, and of itself not capable of any good will. And that apart from grace alone, free will is nothing, can do nothing, does nothing, except depraved deeds. Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based, and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system, they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man- \u2013 dignity of man. Catholic, and semi-pelagianism, with all of its emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace, finally views free will as the decisive factor in attaining salvation, thereby conceptualizing free will, as similar to a healthy man- \u2013 healthy human understanding. For how can a person, be responsible for his deeds, if he possesses no free will? This is what Erasmus asked. How can he decide between good and evil? So reasoned Erasmus. Such arguments, long known to Luther, and many times presented to him, impressed him not in the least. God alone is salvation. God alone measures guilt. He alone condemns. He alone grants grace. Justifies and saves. When he will, and whom he will. Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative. Man can only accept the divine judgment. This is in fact best. And if by \u2014 and \u2014 and it is by the divine prerogative, that man will \u2014 uh, that man is well provided for. For God alone is infallible, and his being is grace and mercy. This concept, that man is divinely elected to salvation, or to damnation, is the center of the predestination dogma, that later, the Geneva reformer Calvin, made the center of his teaching, and that subsequently, under other historical preconditions and circumstances, could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class, in the Netherlands, and in England. Um, uh, skip this paragraph. This is the paragraph though. Right here, the next one, p- on page three twelve, when you, when you read \u2013 if you wanna read it later. Therefore, Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine. Such arguments, on the contrary, necessarily appeared to Luther, given his theological orientation, as suspicious, from the very start, because they originated from human nature, which exalted itself against God. The whore reason prefers to submit to the Devil, adjusts to all situations, and proves everything, that is demanded of her. Human nature, does not possess free will. It is like a horse, ridden by God or the Devil. The rider possesses the will. The horse obeys. Well that's as clear as you can get it. Human nature is like a horse, ridden by God or the Devil. The rider possesses free will. The horse obeys. Alright that, th- now the debate is joined you see. And as you come \u2014 as Erasmus comes to this, he's going to say, well let's look at the Scriptures. Now, number one, we have to admit first \u2013 v- first off, that there seem to be passages, there are passages in the Scriptures. Are there not? Many. Which seem to teach, that man is responsible for his deeds, and that he may act, and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God. Isn't that clear in the Scriptures? Whosoever will may come. Um, Jesus turned to his disciples, you remember, when some deserted him, and seemed, because they were disappointed in some of his sayings, and they were offended by some of the things he said, and they walked no longer with him it said. And then he turned to those who remained, and he said, will ye also go away? They had a choice. Didn't they? Will you go away? What do you will? And the will, apparently was, re- resided in in these disciples. And so Erasmus is going to say, so obviously, in Scripture we have paradox. We have clear passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate that man has a free will, and that he can exercise that will, to follow, or not to follow. To respond or not to respond. On the other hand, we have passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate, that the will is not free, and that the \u2013, and that man i- th- is \u2013 man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God.", "human1": "A lecturer explains Luther's views on free will and his correspondence with Erasmus to a classroom using a textbook."}, "GUM_conversation_family": {"fulltext": "Yeah.

It's not displaced very far anyway, and it's um, pretty much, you know, locked in place, so to speak. Um, so I think that she would, she would do fine with a cast. Um, and, I pretty much got an estimate so far, with the, coming in yesterday, and the x-rays and everything, the bill was about fifty-four. And to do a cast, um, with the anasthesia, and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff, and then the casting material, probably the \u2014 It's gonna be about a hundred and fifty-three, total. And, the only, then it would be, the only extra would be, in about six to eight weeks, we'd have her come in again, we would tranquilize her, and take the X-rays, and see if it's healed, enough to take off. And that's generally about thirty-four to forty, somewhere in there. Yeah. You know, a pin, you know, if we did a pin, it's probably, it would probably be even a hundred more but, so it's it's that's about the \u2014 at this point the, the least expensive alternative that probably will work for her.

It was spring, the barren time in March when you can not be sure if it is really warmer, but you are so desperate for change that you tell yourself the mud at the edge of the sidewalk is different from winter mud and you are sure that the smell of wet soil has suddenly a bit of the scent of summer rains, of grass and drowned earthworms. And it has, because it is spring and inside the ground something is stirring. I was wearing a yellow linen dress which my mother had picked out and which I therefore disliked although I knew it flattered me. My shoes were white and I was concentrating on keeping them out of the mud. My father and I were going to mass \u2014 my mother did not go; she was Protestant. My father put his hand on top of my hair, his palm on my head, and I could feel the bone of my skull and my skin and his hot palm, so dry and strong. When I was a little girl, he did that often, and called me Muscles. He had not called me Muscles or put his hand on my head for a long time. I could not help arching my back a little, I wanted to push against his hand like a cat but the instinct that comes with being thirteen, the half-understood caution that makes a girl timid, or wild, the shyness told me to just walk. I wanted to feel the rough edge of the pocket of his coat against my cheek, but I was too tall. I wanted to be seven again, and safe. But I still wanted to push against his hand and put my hand in his pocket and steal the leather palmed glove, that secret animal. Instead I went into the church, took a Bulletin, dipped my finger in Holy Water and genuflected. The inside of the church smelled like damp wood and furniture polish, not alive at all. My father took off his coat and draped it over the edge of the pew and when I came back from communion I stole his glove. The paper taste of the wafer was still in my mouth and I took a deep breath of the leather. It smelled like March. We walked back through the school because it was drizzling, my father tall in his navy suit and my shoes going click on the linoleum. There were two classes of each grade, starting at the sixth and going down to the first. The hall ended in a T and we went left through the gym, walked underneath the bleachers and stood next to the side door, waiting for the rain to stop. It was dark under the bleachers. My father was a young man, thirty-five, younger because he liked to be outside, to play softball on Saturday and to take my mother and me camping on vacation. He stood rocked back on his heels with his coat thrown over his shoulders and his hands in his pockets. I thought of bacon and eggs, toast with peach jam out of the jar. I was so hungry. The space under the bleachers was secret and dark. There were things in the shadows; a metal pail, a mop, rags. Next to the door was a tall wrought-iron candle holder \u2014 the kind that stood at either end of the altar. There was no holder and the end was jagged. On the floor was a wrapper from a French Chew. They were sold at eighth-grade basketball games on Friday nights. The light from the door made the shadows under the bleachers darker, the long space stretched far away. I heard the rain and the faint rustle of paper and smelled damp concrete. I did not go near my father but kept my hand in my pocket, feeling the soft leather glove. There was a rustling on the concrete and the drizzle of soft rain. I wondered if anyone ever went back under the bleachers, if there were crickets or mice there. The rustling might have been mice. I wished the rain would stop. I wanted to go home. I made noises with my heels but they were too loud so I stopped. Something else clicked and I tried to see what it was but couldn\u2019t see anything. It wasn\u2019t as loud as my heels. My father cleared his throat, looking out the door. I imagined a man down there in the dark, an escaped convict or a madman. It had nearly stopped raining. In fifteen minutes we would be home and my mother would fry eggs. I heard a noise like paper. My father heard it, too, but he pretended not to, at least he didn\u2019t turn his head. And there was a heavier sound, a rasp, like a box pulled over concrete. I looked at my father but he didn\u2019t turn his head. I wished he would turn his head. There was a click again and the rustle, and I could not think of what it could be. I had no explanation for the particular combination of sounds. No doubt there was, some two things that happened to be making noises at the same time.

Satellite coverage in Santa\u2019s Village was just another Christmas miracle, like faster-than-light travel and stuffing oneself through gas fireplaces with neither explosions nor lawsuits nipping at your heels.

So Betty had made Christmas Eve dinner while listening to \u2014 instead of participating in \u2014 the big special ops campaign game online.

His white V-neck undershirt was tucked into his pants in front, pulled taught over his belly. It stretched the neckhole halfway down to his happy trail. His hands were finding their way through the armholes of his robe. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there are more children in the world now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Santa\u2019s not getting any younger, ho ho ho.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t get much older either,\u201d Betty said.

Santa bent down to pick them up, mumbling about \u201cemergency money.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you get dressed in the bedroom like a normal person?\u201d Betty asked. Distorted shouting erupted from Betty\u2019s headset. She imagined red and yellow mosaic bursts lighting up the sunless snowscape outside, as if there was an HDTV behind the blinds instead of their kitchen window. One of her boys probably stepped on a landmine. Williams, she guessed. She thought she could hear Gomez laughing. She picked up the pans in which she\u2019d made the potatoes and maple glaze.

His parents were always too busy and often a little too serious, but his grandmother had a sense of peace about her, a lightness that lifted his spirit. A few times, when Tyler\u2019s parents were away, she took him with her to church. He remembered liking the singing and the colorful windows, and how safe he felt there, in that large, empty space, sitting on a hard bench next to her warmth. When she died, grief overwhelmed Tyler. But like most adults, when he grew older he could only recall the intensity of that love in childhood in an abstract way. He made the common error of identifying maturity with worth, and assumed that the love he had for her as a young child must have been lacking in strength and depth. For many years after her death, however, Tyler was tortured by the memory of a certain visit from her. He was five or so, and they were playing some board game at the kitchen table. As he swung his legs in his excitement, he kicked her repeatedly in the shins. She asked him to stop, and he refused, giggling. When she finally frowned at him and threatened to stop playing if he didn\u2019t stop he told her to go to Hell. In Tyler\u2019s mind he could see her face grow taut, lose color, and then, for the only time he could remember, she began to cry. He also remembered his own utter confusion. His parents did not have much use for religion and so for him Hell was a word without much mystery or power. At that time he knew only vaguely that Hell was a place you did not want to go, like the dark basement or the even darker attic. He remembered feeling resentful that she was crying and he did not even understand why. Tyler felt the guilt of this memory even in his teenage years. For him it summed up all his insecurities and fears about his own cruelty, ignorance, and the possibility that he was, in reality, not a good person. The fact that he had caused someone who loved him such pain with so little effort and understanding troubled him deeply. One day Tyler looked through an old family photo album, and in it was a picture of the kitchen in the house they used to live in. He was surprised to discover that the small kitchen contained a central island, and had no space for the table in his memory at all. With the discovery of that single error in his memory came a cascade of other revelations. Now he remembered that they always ate in the dining room, and when they did play board games, it was always on the coffee table in the living room. The memory that had caused him such pain over the years could not possibly have occurred. Somehow, he must have manufactured the whole scene in his imagination. It was not very hard to explain what really happened, he thought. The death of his grandmother had probably caused in him feelings of abandonment and guilt. In his confusion he had taken elements from storybooks and imagined out of nothing this memory to punish himself. This was the sort of fantasy that could have occurred to any young child who lost an important relative. With that realization, the image of his grandmother crying faded in his memory and became less and less believable. Tyler thought he was very lucky to have discovered the single error in his false memory, which enabled him to reason his way into distinguishing between reality and fantasy. He felt that it was a coming-of-age moment. Nonetheless, he admitted to himself that he was a little sad also at the discovery. For however imaginary that memory was, it was also a part of his love for his grandmother. When that memory lost its compelling aura of truth, it was like another part of her died with it.

Mom digs out Cara\u2019s inhaler and Cara dutifully takes a hit. I tried it once and it was pretty dreadful. It felt really weird, trying to get that stuff in my lungs, and it made me feel a little buzzy but it didn\u2019t even feel good, so it\u2019s pretty amazing that Cara will do it. Cara sits in her booster seat in the back of the car, wheezing all the way home, getting worse and worse, and by the time we pull in the driveway, she\u2019s got that white look around her mouth. \u201cRobert,\u201d Mom says, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to take her to the Emergency Room.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d I say and get out of the car. \u201cYou want to call your dad?\u201d Mom asks. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll be.\u201d Mom checks her watch.

They disappeared immediately, drunk down into the mineral silence. The garden paused, and everything held its breath and waited. More rain would come. Everyone knew, beyond belief or necessity that the time had come. And with it, the rain. Heavy oily drops bounced from leaf to grass to dusty ground, gathering in stems and folds on the way. Yet still the sky was a hard polished blue with not a cloud in sight. Still the garden held its breath. It would not be long now. A spattering of drops plucked memories from deep in the roots, shivering through shoots and tendrils, humus and stone. Wispy vapour trails marbled the blue surface above. And then it rained for good. We sat on the porch watching, no longer daring to dart out and leap around in the downfall as drops turned to torrents and the staccato tapping on the roof climaxed to a thunderous roar. Pools erupted and overflowed along the edges of the lawn, cascading around the raspberry canes and over the flower beds. Earthworms rose up from the water-laden earth where they could no longer breath and wriggled and struggled fro air on the surface, writhing and swimming for a safe haven. Water burst over the barrels and cans standing under the eaves and gutters, flooding the pathways, carrying away all that wasn\u2019t fixed solid and licking at the stairs to the back porch before climbing each step and lapping against the planks we were sitting on, a wooden raft surrounded by angry water and martial beat drum, drum, drumming on the roof above. We slipped out feet over the sides and when we felt the fish, some as big as logs, some as small as leaves, nibble at our feet, we leant over to watch them fraying and frolicking under the choppy surface. Waves lapped at the porch, washing away the boxes, and bowls, and the dog\u2019s basket. The rocking chair, the watering can, boxes of cuttings, and tied-up newspapers, all floated away as we slammed the kitchen door shut and retreated to the front room we gazed out at the river that the street had become. The sky was pewter smeared with charcoal now, and pressed down hard on the rooftops, slowly dissolving everything below. When the water rippled into the hallway, we splashed our way to the staircase and then up as it nipped at our heels. Outside the other houses were rocks surrounded by sea with mermaids swimming all around, flapping their scaly tails and hauling themselves up, to fall backwards into the crest of the oncoming waves. And as they swam they sang, their voices born on the winds and the salt and the rain, and we could hear them singing, He is coming, He is coming. And they combed their long hair in preparation. We waved and called, and they laughed and played, tantalising, their seaweed locks just out of reach. With a flick of the tail they were off, still singing, He is coming, He is coming, until their voices were lost in the noise of the rain and the water. A great whiskered head arose, then a belly, wet and sleek, long enough to wrap itself twice around the world. \u201cIs it him?\u201d we asked each other, nudging elbows and climbing onto the chairs. We pulled off wet socks and shoes, letting them float away on the tide, before the great worm turned and the wake engulfed the creaking, cracking house. We clambered up onto the roof, sliding on the tiles and clinging to chimney stacks, sheltering our eyes from the driving downpour. The sky was black, and the stormy sea all the deepest, darkest blues and greens and greys and flecked with white where the sea-horses galloped. The waters broke making way for the gnarled head of a whale, spouting water high against the clouds before opening its whiskered maw and in a looming, booming voice called: He is coming, He is coming. The chimneys washed away, so we scrambled onto the blue-black back encrusted with barnacles and cockles like stars in a night sky and held on tight as he rode the waves, dipping and blowing, dipping and blowing. The wind and the rain tugged at our hair. And still it rained. We heard a fearsome creaking and cracking and before our eyes a great patch of sky peeled away, deeping down in the troughs and riding the crests with torn sails set against the wind. It was a galleon with masts like a dead man\u2019s fingers, tarred timbers groaning and a mermaid sat on the bow as he ship dipped and passed. He is coming, He is coming, she sang out. And just as the wash hit us, prising us from the whale\u2019s speckled back and down into the sea, someone threw down a knotted rope and we hung on for dear life. The singing sailors hauled us aboard chanting, He\u2019s a coming-ha! He\u2019s a coming-ha! And we fell onto the deck like fish bursting from a net.

And after the war, I had buried my children, all four, in white linen shrouds in the new graveyards plowed into what used to be our farmland: all the land stretching from the river delta to the hills. I had one granddaughter who survived the war. I saw her sometimes: in a bright pink dress, a sparkling drink in her hand, on the arm of some foreign officer with brocade on his shoulders, at the edge of a marble patio. She never looked back at me \u2014 poverty and failure and political disrepute being all, these days, contagious and synonymous. The young were mostly dead, and the old men had been taken away, they told us, to learn important new things and to come back when they were ready to contribute fully.

And it was in a grandmother bar by the waterfront \u2014 sipping hot tea with rum and watching over the shoulders of dockworkers playing mah-jongg \u2014 that I first heard of the valley of giants. We all laughed at the idea, except for a chemist with a crooked nose and rouge caked in the creases of her face, who was incensed. \u201cWe live in the modern era!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself!\" The traveler stood up from the table.

Her eyes were veined with red. \u201cNonetheless,\u201d the traveler said, and she walked out. They were laughing at the chemist as well as at the traveler. To find anyone still proud, anyone who believed in giants or shame, was hilarious. The air of the bar was acrid with triumph. Finding someone even more vulnerable and foolish than we were, after everything had been taken from us \u2014 that was a delight. But I followed the traveler, into the wet streets. The smell of fish oozed from the docks. Here and there were bits of charred debris in the gutters. I caught her at her door. She invited me in for tea and massage. Her limbs were weathered and ringed, like the branches of trees in the dry country. She smelled like honey that has been kept a while in a dark room, a little fermented. A heady smell. In the morning, brilliant sunlight scoured the walls and the floor, and the traveler and her pack were gone. I hurried home. My house had survived the war with all its brown clay walls intact, though the garden and the courtyard were a heap of blackened rubble. My house was empty and cold. I packed six loaves of flatbread, some olives, a hard cheese, one nice dress, walking clothes, my pills and glasses, a jug of wine, a can-teen of water, and a kitchen knife. I sat in the shadow in my living room for a while, looking at the amorphous mass of the blanket I had been crocheting. That granddaughter: her parents both worked in the vineyards, and when she was a child, she would play in my courtyard in the after-noons.

An empire whose costly mistakes would for many years to come echo into every corner of the known galaxy. And with those mistakes would come death to billions of innocent, unsuspecting lives. A starfighter hurtled through the scattered metal, the pilot desperate to find a way to stop himself from joining the ever growing population of this interstellar graveyard. Jacques Chalmers was not alone in his frustration with the current situation, but he was doubtless one of the most panicked. He tried to steady himself as he began cycling once again through the available display options for his starfighter's radar system. His anxiety continued to grow with each passing second, every change of the screen doing nothing to abate it. He stopped midway through the calibration and glanced out of his cockpit. The scene was the same as it had been a few moments ago and it brought him no comfort. He couldn't count the number of capital ships that dominated the Enemy's frontline. Twenty? Thirty? Fifty? In his years of service to the Imperial Naval Forces he had never seen anything like it, not even in archive war footage. The enormous forms of the battleships loomed like giants atop a hill, staring down upon a tiny village below. Then there were the Enemy starfighters themselves: hundreds at least, swarming about like a huge wall of locusts. Knowing that he had already been flying straight for longer than was advisable, Chalmers altered his course to attempt to throw off any pursuers. * * * Not long before he had been standing on the flight deck of his deployment carrier, amongst the other pilots, his heart pumping in his ears, his hands sweating as he awaited the order to board his fighter. Chalmers saw his friends run forward as their names were called out, scrambling into cockpits, pulling on helmets and performing last-minute safety checks. Though most hid it well, he was convinced they were all as nervous and scared as he was - knowing they could well be speeding only to their own deaths. As he watched his friends' fighters hurtle down the catapult, his commanding officer had addressed the last remaining pilots still standing on the flight deck. \u201cRight, listen up,\u201d he started. \u201cThis is where we must make our stand. The Enemy cannot be allowed to advance any further. Tonight we fight the battle for Kethlan and for the Imperium; the battle for our survival. Hundreds of millions of lives are depending on our actions here. Make them proud!\u201d Hundreds of millions? thought Chalmers. Is that all that's left? A few months ago it was billions. This day had crept ever closer as cities, planets and then entire star systems had fallen to the Enemy; to those damned Pandorans; to the Senate's mistake. How many of his friends had he lost over these last few terrible months? Had they died fast or were they now suffering a fate far worse..? As his CO continued to pump them up for the critical battle, Chalmers' head was filled with visions of row upon row of black-clad soldiers. A white emblem resided on their right arms and left breast, an all-encompassing full black helmet upon their heads, its smooth form negating all facial features. Two bright red oval spheres were set into an eye-level groove that ran all around, the \u201ceyes\u201d themselves slanted into a menacing and intimidating scowl. One of the soldiers turned to face him, the ruby-like eyes seeming to pierce his very soul. He felt his hand tighten on the flight helmet he held, swallowing hard. \u201cDaniels! Peterson! Foster! Brown! Rye ...\u201d a voice called out above the other sounds that filled the flight deck. Feet moved and Chalmers felt his stomach lurch. His name would be called soon. He felt a sense of doom. If the Empire could not stop the Enemy before, what hope did they have now? The Enemy's power had grown exponentially and they had crushed everything in their path with harrowing little effort. Chalmers was feeling forced to accept the truth: they were all that was left of the Imperial Naval Forces. This was a battle that could not be won; not now, not ever. \u201c... Tyler! Flynn! Chalmers! King! Golden! Blair ...\u201d At the sound of his name, Chalmers felt himself move robotically, his mind screaming in protest against what his legs were doing. He ran over to the waiting starfighter, threw on his helmet and begun ascending the ladder into the cockpit. Zombie-like he sank down into the seat, watching as if from outside his body as his hands buckled him in, his fingers flip switches, press buttons, acknowledge questions and confirmations on the screens before him. Moments later, his craft was taxied to the catapult and before long he'd found himself out in space and into the thick of battle. At that moment, his worst fears had not only been altogether realised, but far exceeded.", "human1": "Jacques Chalmers, a starfighter pilot for the Empire, is terrified of overwhelming enemy forces as he leaves his deployment carrier together with his comrades, and later narrowly escapes the Enemy after witnessing the destruction of the Kethlan system."}, "GUM_fiction_lunre": {"fulltext": "Chapter Two: Master Lunre My father\u2019s actions were largely incomprehensible to me, guided by his own secret and labyrinthine calculations. He dwelt in another world, a world of intrigue, bargains, contracts and clandestine purchases of land all over the island. He was in many ways a world in himself, whole as a sphere. No doubt his decisions were perfectly logical in his own eyes \u2014 even the one that prompted him, a patriotic islander, to bring me a tutor from Bain: Master Lunre, an Olondrian. The day began as it usually did when my father was expected home from his travels, the house festooned with flowers and stocked with coconut liquor. We stood by the gate, washed and perfumed and arrayed in our brightest clothes, my mother twisting her hands in her skirt, my father\u2019s wife with red eyes. Jom, grown taller and broad in the shoulders, moaned gently to himself, while I stood nervously rubbing the heel of one sandal on the flagstones. We scanned the deep blue valley for the first sign of the company, but before we saw them we heard the children shouting: \u201cA yellow man!\u201d A yellow man! We glanced at one another in confusion. My mother bit her lower lip; Jom gave a groan of alarm. At first I thought the children meant my father, whose golden skin, the color of the night-monkey\u2019s pelt, was a rarity in the islands; but certainly the children of Tyom were familiar with my father, and would never have greeted a council-member with such ill-mannered yells. Then I remembered the only \u201cyellow man\u201d I had ever seen, an Olondrian wizard and doctor who had visited Tyom in my childhood, who wore two pieces of glass on his eyes, attached to his ears with wires, and roamed the hills of Tinimavet, cutting bits off the trees. I have since learned that that doctor wrote a well-received treatise, On the Medicinal Properties of the Juice of the Young Coconut, and died a respected man in his native city of Deinivel; but at the time I felt certain he had returned with his sack of tree-cuttings. \u201cThere they are,\u201d said Pavit, the head house-servant, in a strained voice. And there they were: a chain of riders weaving among the trees. My father\u2019s plaited umbrella appeared, his still, imposing figure, and beside him another man, tall and lean, astride an island mule. The hectic screams of the children preceded the company into the village, so that they advanced like a festival, drawing people out of their houses. As they approached I saw that my father\u2019s face was shining with pride, and his bearing had in it a new hauteur, like that of the old island kings. The man who rode beside him, looking uncomfortable with his long legs, kept his gaze lowered and fixed between the ears of his plodding mule. He was not yellow, but very pale brown, the color of raw cashews; he had silver hair, worn cropped close to the skull so that it resembled a cap. He was not the leaf-collecting doctor, but an altogether strange man, with silver eyebrows in his smooth face and long fine-knuckled hands. As he dismounted in front of the house I heard my mother whispering: \u201cProtect us, God with the Black-and-White Tail, from that which is not of this earth.\u201d My father dismounted from his mule and strutted toward us, grinning. I thought I caught an odor off him, of fish, sea-sickness and sweat.

It was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where I wandered; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild and many-coloured dreams. And as I walked by the shallow crystal stream I saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light, as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world. Silent and sparkling, bright and baleful, those moon-cursed waters hurried I knew not whither; whilst from the embowered banks white lotos-blossoms fluttered one by one in the opiate night-wind and dropped despairingly into the stream, swirling away horribly under the arched, carven bridge, and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm, dead faces. And as I ran along the shore, crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces, I saw that the garden had no end under that moon; for where by day the walls were, there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths, flowers and shrubs, stone idols and pagodas, and bendings of the yellow-litten stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble. And the lips of the dead lotos-faces whispered sadly, and bade me follow, nor did I cease my steps till the stream became a river, and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea. Upon that sea the hateful moon shone, and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes breeded. And as I saw therein the lotos-faces vanish, I longed for nets that I might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night. But when that moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore, I saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered, and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed. And knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come, I trembled and did not wish again to speak with the lotos-faces. Yet when I saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef, I would fain have questioned him, and asked him of those whom I had known when they were alive. This I would have asked him had he not been so far away, but he was very far, and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef. So I watched the tide go out under that sinking moon, and saw gleaming the spires, the towers, and the roofs of that dead, dripping city. And as I watched, my nostrils tried to close against the perfume-conquering stench of the world's dead; for truly, in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy sea-worms to gnaw and glut upon. Over these horrors the evil moon now hung very low, but the puffy worms of the sea need no moon to feed by. And as I watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath, I felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown, as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it. Nor had my flesh trembled without cause, for when I raised my eyes I saw that the waters had ebbed very low, shewing much of the vast reef whose rim I had seen before. And when I saw that the reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below, I shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters, and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon.

Most people would say it started with the Fireflies, but they'd be wrong. It ended with all those things. For me, it began with Robert Paglino. At the age of eight, he was my best and only friend. We were fellow outcasts, bound by complementary misfortune. Mine was developmental. His was genetic: an uncontrolled genotype that left him predisposed to nearsightedness, acne, and (as it later turned out) a susceptibility to narcotics. His parents had never had him optimized. Those few TwenCen relics who still believed in God also held that one shouldn't try to improve upon His handiwork. So although both of us could have been repaired, only one of us had been. I arrived at the playground to find Pag the center of attention for some half-dozen kids, those lucky few in front punching him in the head, the others making do with taunts of mongrel and polly while waiting their turn. I watched him raise his arms, almost hesitantly, to ward off the worst of the blows. I could see into his head better than I could see into my own; he was scared that his attackers might think those hands were coming up to hit back, that they'd read it as an act of defiance and hurt him even more. Even then, at the tender age of eight and with half my mind gone, I was becoming a superlative observer. But I didn't know what to do. I hadn't seen much of Pag lately. I was pretty sure he'd been avoiding me. Still, when your best friend's in trouble you help out, right? Even if the odds are impossible \u2014 and how many eight-year-olds would go up against six bigger kids for a sandbox buddy? \u2014 at least you call for backup. Flag a sentry. Something. I just stood there. I didn't even especially want to help him. That didn't make sense. Even if he hadn't been my best friend, I should at least have empathized. I'd suffered less than Pag in the way of overt violence; my seizures tended to keep the other kids at a distance, scared them even as they incapacitated me. Still. I was no stranger to the taunts and insults, or the foot that appears from nowhere to trip you up en route from A to B. I knew how that felt. Or I had, once. But that part of me had been cut out along with the bad wiring. I was still working up the algorithms to get it back, still learning by observation. Pack animals always tear apart the weaklings in their midst. Every child knows that much instinctively. Maybe I should just let that process unfold, maybe I shouldn't try to mess with nature. Then again, Pag's parents hadn't messed with nature, and look what it got them: a son curled up in the dirt while a bunch of engineered superboys kicked in his ribs. In the end, propaganda worked where empathy failed. Back then I didn't so much think as observe, didn't deduce so much as remember \u2014 and what I remembered was a thousand inspirational stories lauding anyone who ever stuck up for the underdog. So I picked up a rock the size of my fist and hit two of Pag's assailants across the backs of their heads before anyone even knew I was in the game. A third, turning to face the new threat, took a blow to the face that audibly crunched the bones of his cheek. I remember wondering why I didn't take any satisfaction from that sound, why it meant nothing beyond the fact I had one less opponent to worry about. The rest of them ran at the sight of blood. One of the braver promised me I was dead, shouted \"Fucking zombie!\" over his shoulder as he disappeared around the corner. Three decades it took, to see the irony in that remark. Two of the enemy twitched at my feet. I kicked one in the head until it stopped moving, turned to the other. Something grabbed my arm and I swung without thinking, without looking until Pag yelped and ducked out of reach. \"Oh,\" I said. \"Sorry.\" One thing lay motionless. The other moaned and held its head and curled up in a ball. \"Oh shit,\" Pag panted. Blood coursed unheeded from his nose and splattered down his shirt. His cheek was turning blue and yellow. \"Oh shit oh shit oh shit ...\" I thought of something to say. \"You all right?\" \"Oh shit, you \u2014 I mean, you never ...\" He wiped his mouth. Blood smeared the back of his hand. \"Oh man are we in trouble.\" \"They started it.\" \"Yeah, but you \u2014 I mean, look at them!\" The moaning thing was crawling away on all fours. I wondered how long it would be before it found reinforcements. I wondered if I should kill it before then. \"You'da never done that before,\" Pag said. Before the operation, he meant. I actually did feel something then \u2014 faint, distant, but unmistakable. I felt angry. \"They started \u2014\" Pag backed away, eyes wide. \"What are you doing? Put that down!\" I'd raised my fists. I didn't remember doing that. I unclenched them. It took a while. I had to look at my hands very hard for a long, long time. The rock dropped to the ground, blood-slick and glistening. \"I was trying to help.\" I didn't understand why he couldn't see that. \"You're, you're not the same,\" Pag said from a safe distance. \"You're not even Siri any more.\" \"I am too. Don't be a fuckwad.\" \"They cut out your brain!\" \"Only half. For the ep \u2014\" \"I know for the epilepsy! You think I don't know? But you were in that half \u2014 or, like, part of you was ...\" He struggled with the words, with the concept behind them. \"And now you're different. It's like, your mom and dad murdered you \u2014\" \"My mom and dad,\" I said, suddenly quiet, \"saved my life. I would have died.\" \"I think you did die,\" said my best and only friend. \"I think Siri died, they scooped him out and threw him away and you're some whole other kid that just, just grew back out of what was left.

Shoo! Get out of my bathroom!\u201d I threw down my pen and dashed down the hall. Jenna was picking herself up off the floor of the bathroom.

For a generous girl, a girl who took off her clothes with abandon, she was remarkably close-mouthed about some things. In two months Carroll had learned that her parents lived on a farm several miles outside of town; that they sold strawberries in summer, and Christmas trees in the winter. He knew that they never left the farm; instead, the world came to them in the shape of weekend picnickers and driveby tourists. Do you think your parents will like me?\" he said. He had spent the afternoon preparing for this visit as carefully as if he were preparing for an exam. He had gotten his hair cut, trimmed his nails, washed his neck and behind his ears. The outfit he had chosen, khaki pants and a blue button-down shirt -- no tie -- lay neatly folded on the bed. He stood before Rachel in his plain white underwear and white socks, gazing at her as if she were a mirror. \"No,\" she said. It was the first time she had been to his apartment, and she stood square in the center of his bedroom, her arms folded against her body as if she was afraid to sit down, to touch something. \"Why?\" \"My father will like you,\" she said. \"But he likes everyone. My mother's more particular -- she thinks that you lack a serious nature.\" Carroll put on his pants, admiring the crease. \"So you've talked to her about me.\" \"Yes.\" \"But you haven't talked about her to me.\" \"No.\" \"Are you ashamed of her?\" Rachel snorted. Then she sighed in a way that seemed to suggest she was regretting her decision to take him home. \"You're ashamed of me,\" he guessed, and Rachel kissed him and smiled and didn't say anything. Rachel still lived on her parents' farm, which made it all the more remarkable that she had kept Carroll and her parents apart for so long. It suggested a talent for daily organization that filled Carroll's heart with admiration and lust. She was nineteen, two years younger than Carroll; she was a student at Jellicoh College and every weekday she rose at seven and biked four miles into town, and then back again on her bike, four miles uphill to the farm. Carroll met Rachel in the Jellicoh College library, where he had a part-time job. He sat at the checkout desk, stamping books and reading Tristram Shandy for a graduate class; he was almost asleep when someone said, \"Excuse me.\" He looked up. The girl who stood before the tall desk was red-headed. Sunlight streaming in through a high window opposite her lit up the fine hairs on her arm, the embroidered flowers on the collar of her white shirt. The sunlight turned her hair to fire and Carroll found it difficult to look directly at her. \"Can I help you?\" he said. She placed a shredded rectangle on the desk, and Carroll picked it up between his thumb and forefinger. Pages hung in tatters from the sodden blue spine. Title, binding, and covers had been gnawed away. \"I need to pay for a damaged book,\" she said. \"What happened? Did your dog eat it?\" he said, making a joke. \"Yes,\" she said, and smiled. \"What's your name?\" Carroll said.

And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch\u2014into futurity. \u201cAs I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then\u2014though I was still travelling with prodigious velocity\u2014the blinking succession of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set\u2014it simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a desolate beach grew visible. \u201cI stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round. The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual twilight. \u201cThe machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick incrustation of salt\u2014pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now. \u201cFar away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antenn\u00e6, like carters\u2019 whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.", "human1": "The protagonist travels to the future using a time machine and arrives on an Earth with thin air, now tidally locked to face the sun, where, on a sloping beach next to rocks covered in vegetation, he sees a huge white butterfly and a monstrous crab-like creature."}, "GUM_fiction_veronique": {"fulltext": "The Cost to Be Wise Veronique stayed with me that night, lying next to me in my blankets and furs.

Introduction I The Chemical Wedding by Christian Rosencreutz is the way I\u2019ve decided to present the title of this book. Most versions in English are called The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosencreutz, which suggests (and most people who\u2019ve heard of it suppose) that the wedding is Christian\u2019s. It\u2019s not; Christian Rosencreutz is the purported author of a book called The Chemical Wedding. The actual author is Johann Valentin Andreae, whose name didn\u2019t appear on the book originally, thus ensuring the confusion. I\u2019ll call it herein (as everyone mostly does) simply The Chemical Wedding. Though its original readers would have had a certain amount of context for the truly bizarre and surprising events it tells of, it\u2019s possible that The Chemical Wedding is now more enjoyable without knowing that context, and experiencing the book unmediated. You might therefore wish to start right in on the first page of text that follows and only then return to this introduction. Consider a similar case: a little book published in 1934 by the Surrealist artist Max Ernst called Une Semaine de Bont\u00e9. It was made entirely of collaged illustrations cut out of old books The First Day It was just before Easter Sunday, 1 and I was sitting at my table. I\u2019d said my prayers, talking a long time as usual with my Maker and thinking about some of the great mysteries the Father of Lights had revealed to me. Now I was ready to make and to bake \u2013 only in my heart, actually \u2013 a small, perfect unleavened wafer to eat with my beloved Paschal Lamb. All of a sudden a terrible wind blew up, so strong that I thought the hill my little house was built on would be blown apart \u2013 but I\u2019d seen the Devil do things as bad as this before (the Devil had often tried to harm me), so I took heart and went on meditating. Till I felt somebody touch me on the back. This frightened me so that I didn\u2019t dare turn. I tried to stay as brave and calm as a human being could under the circumstances. I felt my coat tugged at, and tugged again, and at last I looked around. A woman stood there, so bright and beautiful, in a sky-colored robe \u2013 a heavens covered with 1 Christian\u2019s story begins just before Easter, like Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy. It can be seen as an allegory of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, though this idea produces some puzzles. The birds sang so beautifully, the young deer skipped so happily, that it gladdened my old heart, and I couldn't help singing too ... THE FOURTH DAY I was awake and lying in bed next morning, looking idly at the wonderful images and inscriptions all around my room, when suddenly I heard the sound of trumpets, as if a procession were already underway. My page jumped out of bed as if crazed, looking more dead than alive, and you can imagine how I felt when he cried, \u201cThey're already being presented to the king!\" I could only groan in frustration and curse my lazy bones. I got dressed, but my page was quicker than I was and ran out of the chamber to see what was what. He soon came back and gave me the good news that I actually hadn\u2019t overslept; all I\u2019d done was miss breakfast: they hadn\u2019t wanted to wake an old man who needed his rest. But now I had to get ready to go with him to the lion fountain, where most of the others were gathered. Such a relief! My spirits recovered, and as soon as I had got into my habit, I followed him to the garden I have already told about. I found that the lion, in place of his sword, now held a rather large plaque. Examining this, I could tell that it had been taken from those ancient monuments I\u2019d seen and put here for some special reason. The inscription on it was fading away, so I should set it down here as it was then, and ask my readers to ponder it: Prince Hermes: Now after humankind has suffered so much harm here I flow having by god\u2019s counsel and with the help of art become a healing balm.

In a recently-accepted Evolution paper Bos and colleagues describe ants appearing to self-medicate. \"I have no doubt that as time goes on, there will be more and more cases documented\" The team used Formica fusca, an ant species that can form thousand-strong colonies. This common black ant eats other insects, and also aphid honeydew. It often nests in tree stumps or under rocks and foraging workers can sometimes be spotted climbing trees. Some ants were infected with Beauveria bassiana, a fungus. Infected ants chose food laced with toxic hydrogen peroxide, whereas healthy ants avoided it. Hydrogen peroxide reduced infected ant fatalities by 15%, and the ants varied their intake depending upon how high the peroxide concentration was. In the wild, Formica fusca can encounter similar chemicals in aphids and dead ants. The Independent reported self-medicating ants a first among insects. Bos obtained his doctorate from the University of Copenhagen. He began postdoctoral research at Helsinki in 2012. He also runs the AntyScience blog. The blog aims to help address \"a gap between scientists and 'the general public'.\" The name is a pun referencing ants, its primary topic, science, and \"non-scientific\" jargon-free communication. He now discusses his work with Wikinews. Beauveria bassiana on a cicada in Bolivia. Image: Danny Newman. What first attracted you to researching ants? Me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies, from beetles, to butterflies and mantids, to ants. We had the ants in an observation nest, and I could just look at them for hours, watching them go about. This was in my third year of Biology study I think. After a while I needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies, and decided to write a couple of professors. I ended up going to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d'Ettorre. I liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I've been working on social insects ever since. What methods and equipment were used for this investigation? This is a fun one. I try to work on a very low budget, and like to build most of the experimental setups myself (we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the 'Nickinator', 'i-Nick' and the 'Nicktendo64'). There's not that much money in fundamental science at the moment, so I try to cut the costs wherever possible. We collected wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree-trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland. We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [aerated concrete]. It's very soft stone that you can easily carve. We carved out little squares for the ants to live in (covered with old CD covers to prevent them escaping!). We then drilled a tunnel to a pot (the foraging arena), where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine and the food without. We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana. Afterwards, each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple of seconds, dried on a cloth and put in the nest. After exposing the ants to the fungus, we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day, and counted how many ants were present on each food-source. Example of aerated concrete, which provided a home for the subjects. Image: Marco Bernardini. This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have been infected. The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [Reactive Oxygen Species, the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way (as you have to 'force feed' the ROS, as healthy ants, when given the choice, ignore that food-source.) For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while. And afterwards either infected them or not. Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants died. This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis. We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a spectrophotometer. By adding certain chemicals, the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length. The detrimental effect of ROS on spores was easy to measure. We mixed different concentrations of ROS with the spores, plated them out on petridishes with an agar-solution where fungus can grow on. A day after, we counted how many spores were still alive. How reliable do you consider your results to be? The results we got are very reliable. We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants, and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind. This means the experimenter doesn't know which ants belong to which treatment, so it's impossible to influence the results with 'observer bias'. However, of course this is proof in just one species. It is hard to extrapolate to other ants, as different species lead very different lives.", "human1": "Wikinews interviews biologist Nick Bos from the University of Helsinki about his experiments with ants, which show that ants 'self-medicate' by selecting food contaminated with toxic hydrogen peroxide when they are infected with fungus that can be treated using the chemical."}, "GUM_interview_brotherhood": {"fulltext": "Wikinews interviews President of the International Brotherhood of Magicians Wednesday, October 9, 2013 October is National Magic Month in the United States.

For how long have you been involved in performing / studying magic? Over 50 years. I am 61 now so I really started when I was about 10 years old even though I had seen and worked with some basic tricks a few years earlier. I remember going into Hollywood Magic and wanting that big red box with the dragons on it and I didn't even know what it did. The magician behind the counter was wise enough not to sell it to me, but instead sold me two books which I still own today - \"Scarne on Card Tricks\" and \"Scarne on Magic Tricks\". That started me out on books and I have amassed quite a few since then. My major influences on performance are Eugene Burger and Michael Skinner. October is National Magic Month in the US. Do you think magic is alive as a viable form of entertainment today? Absolutely. There are more magicians working today than ever before. There will always be an audience for good magicians doing good magic. Has the internet helped or hurt magic? Both. I think it has helped draw younger people to magic as a hobby, but I think it has hurt the ability of young magicians to think because so many rely on the internet for everything and they aren't reading the books. We have to have knowledge of the history of magic and what has been done before. Moreover, seeing someone perform on the internet takes away the use of our senses, originality and imagination that reading and thinking about magic can produce. Anyone can become a monkey; it takes serious study to become a magician. Do you travel much in your current role? Yes, I am traveling quite a bit. After I was inducted as International President in Phoenix in July, I have been to the Jeff McBride Experience in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, Magic Live in Las Vegas, The Midwest Magic Jubilee in St. Louis, the TAOM in Dallas, the British Ring Convention in Buxton, England and the Magic Circle in London.

At age 80 he continues to write books; his latest book, Hegemony or Survival, was a bestseller in non-fiction. According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index Professor Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time.

On NATO I just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference, I know you\u2019re speaking at the counter-conference. Could be I give so many talks I can\u2019t remember. On the NATO conference, well I mean the obvious question is why should NATO exist? In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed, but now why should it exist. I mean the theory was, whether you believe it or not, that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression, that\u2019s the basic doctrine. Well there\u2019s no defense against Soviet aggression, so whether you believe that doctrine or not that\u2019s gone. When the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement, a recent agreement, between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration. The agreement was that Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession: he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance. Now it is remarkable in the light of history, the history of the past century, Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia, twice, and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance, centered in the most phenomenal military power in history, that\u2019s a real threat. Nevertheless he agreed, but there was a quid pro quo, namely that NATO should not expand to the east, so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone. And George Bush and James Baker, secretary of state, agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east. Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region, but the U.S wouldn\u2019t consider that. Okay, so that was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed. Well, Clinton came into office what did he do? Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east. Well that\u2019s a significant threat to the Soviet Union, to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union, it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity, not much but some. So they rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike, NATO had never rescinded it, but they had and started some remilitarization. With Bush, the aggressive militarism of the Bush administration, as predicted, induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity; it\u2019s still going on right now. When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe, Poland and Czechoslovakia, it was a real provocation to the Soviet Union. I mean that was discussed in U.S arms control journals, that they would have to regard as a potential threat to their strategic deterrent, meaning as a first strike weapon. And the claim was that it had to do with Iranian missiles, but forget about that. Take say on Obama, Obama\u2019s national security advisor James Jones former Marine commandant is on record of favoring expansion of NATO to the south and the east, further expansion of NATO, and also making it an intervention force. And the head of NATO, Hoop Scheffer, he has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes, that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West. Well that\u2019s kind of an unending war, so do we want NATO to exist, do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities, with no pretense of defense? Well I think that\u2019s a pretty good question; I don\u2019t see why it should, I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable \u2014 if there happened to be one I\u2019d be opposed to that too. So I think the first question is, what is this all about, why should we even be debating NATO, is there any reason why it should exist? Labor actions as a revival of the Left We\u2019ve seen mass strikes all around the world, in countries that we wouldn\u2019t expect it. Do you think this is a revival of the Left in the West? Or do you think it\u2019s nothing? It\u2019s really hard to tell. I mean there\u2019s certainly signs of it, and in the United States too, in fact we had a sit down strike in the United States not long ago, which is a very militant labor action. Sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930\u2019s were very threatening to management and ownership, because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management, and probably doing a better job. So that\u2019s a frightening idea, and police were called in and so on. Well we just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory, it\u2019s hard to know, I mean these things are just hard to predict, they may take off, and they may take on a broader scope, they may fizzle away or be diverted.", "human1": "Michael Dranove interviews political activist, linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky about the background of protests against the 60th NATO conference, as well as the revival of leftwing labor actions such as mass strikes in the US and around the world."}, "GUM_interview_cocktail": {"fulltext": "Wikinews interviews New York bar owner on Santorum cocktail Thursday, March 15, 2012 Wikinews interviewed one of the owners of a New York City bar about a popular new politically-themed cocktail drink called Santorum. The beverage was inspired by the santorum neologism coined in advice columnist Dan Savage's column Savage Love in response to comments made by former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum about homosexuality; Savage's readers voted to define santorum as; \"the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.\" Background The santorum neologism has inspired satirical forms of parody, including this political cartoon by Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal webcomic artist Zach Weiner. 2012. Image; Zach Weiner. The Pacific Standard bar is located in Brooklyn, New York, and is co-owned by Jonathan M. Stan and John-Christian G. Rauschenberg. Stan commented on the creation of the Santorum cocktail, \"When he was winning in the polls, I thought, 'OK, I'll do a Santorum'.\" Regarding how long the beverage will be made available, Stan remarked to The Brooklyn Paper, \"We'll keep it around until he\u2019s irrelevant. I hope he\u2019s there the whole way\". The main ingredients of the Santorum drink include vodka of an orange citrus variety, Baileys Irish Cream, and Angostura bitters. It is served in a cocktail glass and topped with Godiva chocolate flakes. The beverage is priced at US $ 8.00, and upon an order for it, the bartender will recount for the customer the definition of the santorum neologism. Troy Patterson of Slate Magazine ventured over to Pacific Standard to sample the new santorum cocktail at the bar. After tasting the beverage, Patterson observed, \"My Santorum was sweet but balanced, with a subtle citrus pucker\". [The santorum neologism is] offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it. \u2014 Rick Santorum In a 2003 interview with the Associated Press, Rick Santorum compared legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States to supporting bestiality. Readers of the Savage Love advice column selected a new definition for the Senator\u2019s last name, and Savage created a website SpreadingSantorum.com to promulgate the spread of the phenomenon. The term became a prominent result in searches online, and gained dominance on Web search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!. Rick Santorum himself has acknowledged and discussed the existence and prevalence of the santorum neologism phenomenon; he was quoted by The Canadian Press on his assessment of Google's response; \"To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their website or through their system is something that they say they can't handle. I suspect that's not true.\" Santorum criticized the response of the press to the phenomenon in a 2011 radio interview, saying, \"It's offensive beyond, you know, anything that any public figure or anybody in America should tolerate, and the mainstream media laughs about it.\" Interview Pacific Standard owner, Jonathan M. Stan, displays the Santorum cocktail drink as a finished product at the bar. (2012). Image; Pacific Standard, provided by the owners. Interview What inspired you to create a cocktail after the santorum neologism? Santorum the person has been in the news throughout the primary season, and we thought it would be interesting to try to create a delicious drink that mimicked the appearance of the Dan Savage meaning of \"santorum.\" How did you first hear about the definition of the santorum neologism that grew out of the contest from the Savage Love advice column? We don't really remember. It's been around forever. Probably read about it somewhere. What are your thoughts about Rick Santorum\u2019s views on gay rights? It's not for us to take a stand on any political issues. We'll leave that to the professionals. Do you think it was an appropriate form of satire for Dan Savage to popularize the definition of the santorum neologism created in his advice column? We thought it was funny. Whether it is appropriate or not is another thing we leave to the pros to decide. When was the Santorum cocktail first created? A few months ago. What ingredients go in the Santorum cocktail? Bailey's, orange vodka, bitters, and chocolate flakes. How is the Santorum drink made? The ingredients are shaken and/or poured into a cocktail glass. See the pictures. Your Santorum cocktail creation has already received media coverage from publications including; The Brooklyn Paper, The New York Times, Jezebel, Metro.us, EDGE on the Net, and Instinct Magazine. Did you think when you created it that the Santorum cocktail would receive this news coverage? Not at all. We were just trying to come up with a topical and funny new cocktail for our customers to laugh about and enjoy. What culinary dishes would you recommend that go well with the Santorum cocktail? You'd probably be having the cocktail at dessert time, so something sweet; ice cream or pie. Is the drink popular? How many times do you suppose you\u2019ve served it at your establishment since its creation? The drink was mildly popular for the last few months, but of course has become a great deal more popular since getting all this publicity.

Image: David Titley. Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h, as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength? Yes, all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters. Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land, the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate. As of the last advisory, T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland, headed on a northwest track. That is a Category 3 storm. The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours. However, there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path. Yes, it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land. This occurs for two reasons: As it moves over land, it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [which is] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much, much smoother than the land surface. Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat, which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain. As tropical cyclones make landfall, this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land. Yes, the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land. Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land. In the mean time, much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength. Yes. All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall. However, they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides, and river flooding. Phailin's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland. Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength. However, and this is important, it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty. File photo of interviewee R Saravanan. Image: R Saravanan. A previous cyclone in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead. Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone? I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm. However, historically, there have been several events that should cause a societal response. Hopefully, we all learn from past mistakes. The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable, with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed, millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion. I don't have enough information to answer this question, one way or the other. From all the press reports that I have read, the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed. The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past. The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate. Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out, which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations. Unfortunately, extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation. My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space. I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history. This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin. I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [...] sponsored by the Indian government. Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region, the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives. I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone. However, the news reports (BBC etc.) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding. Water is the main killer in these storms. From all reports that I have seen, the government was well prepared for this cyclone.

What was your first reaction upon learning there was an undiscovered ecosystem under the ice in the Ross Sea? I was amazed and really excited. I think to say it was unexpected is inaccurate, because it implies that there was a well-founded expectation of something. The technology that Frank and his colleagues are using to explore the ice is so important because, given our lack of data, we have no reasonable expectation of what it should be like, or what it shouldn't be like. There's a return trip planned hopefully for 2015, with both biologists and ANDRILL geologists. Are you intending to go there yourself? I would love to. But I am also happy to not go, as long as someone collects more animals on my behalf! What I want to do with the animals requires new material preserved in diverse ways, but it doesn't require me to be there. Although I am sure that being there would enhance my understanding of the animals and the system in which they live, and would help me formulate more and better questions about the anemones, ship time is expensive, especially in Antarctica, and if there are biologists whose contribution is predicated on being there, they should have priority to be there. These animals are shrouded in mystery. Some of the most intriguing questions are chemical; do they produce some kind of antifreeze, and is that orange glow in the ROV lights their own? Talk us through the difficulties encountered when trying to find answers with the specimens on hand. The samples we have are small in terms of numbers and they are all preserved in formalin (a kind of formaldehyde solution). The formalin is great for preserving structures, but for anemones, it prevents study of DNA or of the chemistry of the body. This means we can't look at the issue you raise with these animals. What we could do, however, was to study anatomy and figure out what it is, so that when we have samples preserved for studying e.g., the genome, transcriptome, or metabolome, or conduct tests of the fluid in the burrows or in the animals themselves, we can make precise comparisons, and figure out what these animals have or do (metabolically or chemically) that lets them live where they live. Just knowing a whole lot about a single species isn't very useful, even if that animal is as special as these clearly are - we need to know what about them is different and thus related to living in this strange way. The only way to get at what's different is to make comparisons with close relatives. We can start that side of the work now, anticipating having more beasts in the future. In terms of their glow, I suspect that it's not theirs - although luminescence is common in anemone relatives, they don't usually make light themselves. They do make a host of florescent proteins, and these may interact with the light of the ROV to give that gorgeous glow. What analysis did you perform on the specimens and what equipment was used? I used a dissecting scope to look at the animal's external anatomy and overall body organization (magnification of 60 X). I embedded a few of the animals in wax and then cut them into very thin slices using a microtome, mounted the slices on microscope slides, stained the slices to enhance contrast, and then looked at those slides under a compound microscope (that's how I got the pictures of the muscles etc in the paper). I used that same compound scope to look at squashed bits of tissue to see the stinging capsules (= nematocysts). I compared the things I saw under the 'scopes to what had been published on other species in this group. This step seems trivial, but it is really the most important part! By comparing my observations to what my colleagues and predecessors had found, I figured out what group it belongs to, and was able to determine that within that group, it was a new species. It was three years between recovery of specimens and final publication, why did it take so long? You mean, how did we manage to make it all happen so quickly, right? :) It was about two years from when Frank sent me specimens to when we got the paper out. Some of that time was just lost time - I had other projects in the queue that I needed to finish. Once we figured out what it was, we played a lot of manuscript email tag, which can be challenging and time consuming given the differing schedules that folks keep in terms of travel, field work, etc. Manuscript review and processing took about four months. What sort of difficulties were posed by the unorthodox preservatives used, and what additional work might be possible on a specimen with intact DNA? The preservation was not unorthodox - they followed best practices for anatomical preservation. Having DNA-suitable material will let us see whether there are new genes, or genes turned on in different ways and at different times that help explain how these animals burrow into hard ice and then survive in the cold. I am curious about the population structure of the \"fields\" of anemones - the group to which Edwardsiella andrillae belongs includes many species that reproduce asexually, and it's possible that the fields are \"clones\" produced asexually rather than the result of sexual reproduction. DNA is the only way to test this. This map shows the location of the Ross Ice Shelf in the Antarctic, and the two known localities for E. andrillae relative to McMurdo Station image: Daily et al.

And, together we formed this thing, it's sort of like an entertainment team. We started it basically, because I wanted to - I wanted to work with Isabel on a lot of projects that we had going on together. We were coming with comics, like, left and right, we were coming up with things like Karis, in high school she came up with that one, I came up with an individual story called Thad's World Destruction and, she wanted to illustrate it, and so, that's the way we ended up doing it. Yep, we like to just make our own original content, and, yep, that's what we wanted to do. How did you two meet? We met back in high school. In this private, tiny-tiny private school of 50 students. But, before hand in middle school, I kept on hearing about this guy named Mario, and he kept on hearing about me, this girl named Isabel. And, everyone, all of our friends and all of our acquaintances would say, \"Hey, you'd get along with him really well.\" So before hand I kinda knew about him, but I never met him. And one of our friends, our common friends, he introduced us during study hall, and we just kind of hit it off from there. It's true. Who else is involved in this project? Currently, we're in talks with people. There's Jeff [Drake], who is behind the camera. Right now, yeah, he's helping us right now. We're talking about doing some individual web series, video series. Josh Kindig, he's coming on board, he has some ideas for that too, he wants to take over \"aywv\" and do more gaming news. There's of course Jason, who is our editor and he's the one who writes dD. Digital Domain What is your purpose behind this venture? Well, back in college, back in Collins College, Isabel and I, we had met like she said at Sandia View Academy, and we went off to college together in Arizona; and ... (how do I best explain this?) Basically, she came up with a few class projects, and I came up with a few class projects; we started working with a few of our friends, and colleagues and whatnot. Those included Drew Cass, Devin Thurlow, people like that. She had several ideas, and she used to draw a lot in the sketchbook, she used to have this thick sketchbook that she used to carry around with her everywhere, where she'd draw these different characters and whatnot; and she was always really shy to show that off to people, and I wanted to help her show that stuff, and I wanted to bring it out to the world. I was a writer, and she always liked my writings, so I was like, let's just get both of our things together, and let's get this done. And for me, what I want the purpose to be, is to inspire people. To bring a little more light to the world is what I want, out of all of this. And what was the verse that we have? First Corinthians 9:25? Yes. Yeah, exactly.

In the interview, Herrick explains what wikiHow is, why he decided to create it, how he grew it in size, and why he chose to use a Creative Commons license (HyperLink) for his site. Read below for more of the interview in full. Interview For our readers who are unaware of your site, could you briefly explain what wikiHow is? Sure. wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual. Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language. We're quite far from our goals currently, but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger We currently have just under 50000 articles and over 1000 featured articles. We hope that in time, we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status. That said, we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve. However, in terms of readership, we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia. We get over 14 million unique visitors per month (source: Google Analytics), which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast. [Note: The interview took place just before the 50000 milestone was met] Like Wikipedia, wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software. Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world. That said, we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects: We are much smaller. The English wikiHow has only 60 admins, compared to the 1000 + on English Wikipedia. As a result, wikiHow is still at the size that every editor eventually gets to know other editors. We are run as a Hybrid Organization - a for-profit company focused on achieving a social good. This has several advantages and disadvantages when compared to the non-profit structure at the Wikimedia Foundation. We show opt-out advertising to anonymous visitors rather than ask for donations. Our advertising revenue funds community meetups and has even allowed us to donate over $ 60,000 to charities such as the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons. (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Contributions-to-Charity). In addition, we've used our revenue on things like buying carbon offsets to become carbon neutral. (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Carbon-Neutral) Our community culture is focused on wikiLove and civility. As a result some folks believe wikiHow is a more humane and enjoyable place to work than other places online. Why did you decide to create wikiHow? I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person. Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine. How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity? I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world. Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful. I've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow. My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow. eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world. eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software. When I ran eHow, the content was professionally produced and edited. This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets. However, paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices. You either 1) sacrifice on breadth and don't produce the topics that won't interest advertisers, or 2) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that doesn't cost much to write. I wasn't interested in making either of these sacrifices, as I think the world's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive. So ultimately I decided that eHow's model would not build the resource I envisioned. When I discovered Wikipedia, I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs. So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow. Why did you decide to use a Creative Commons license? We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork). In my opinion, people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the \"right to leave.\" If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction, they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere. This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license. This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow, the company, will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community. I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far. My hope is that over time, internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others. That said, when we started out I didn't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver's license. As a result, we made some mistakes along the path. In retrospect, I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC. At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects. wikiHow now has millions of visitors per month. How did you grow the site to the size it is today? In December 2008, wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics (Full data: http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics). Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US. (http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com). wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons. First, people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information. People want to learn more practical skills, and for the most part the internet doesn't provide enough quality information yet. Second, we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing: We had some articles of mixed quality, and editors joined to improve those articles, which in turn attracted more readers. We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle: More readers, means more editors, which creates better instructions, leading again to more readers. It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed.", "human1": "Jack Herrick, founder of the how-to guide website wikiHow, talks to Wikinews about the success of his website, how it differs from his previous venture, eHow, and the reasons why he chose a Creative Commons license for wikiHow, which allows contributors to retain ownership of their content."}, "GUM_interview_licen": {"fulltext": "Wikinews interviews academic Simon Li\u010den about attitudes towards US Paralympics Saturday, November 16, 2013 A Russian stamp for Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014 On Thursday, with 110 days until the start of the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, Wikinews interviewed Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership, Sport Studies and Educational / Counseling Psychology at Washington State University Simon Li\u010den about attitudes in United States towards the Paralympics. Li\u010den has recently joined the Sport Management Program at Washington State University to develop its sport media and communication research and teaching contents. Originally from Slovenia, he served as the Director of Media and Communications of a WTA Tour event and was a member of the UNESCO Slovenian National Commission. He was also the Team Manager of the Slovenian wheelchair basketball national team. Why do you think the Paralympic movement has so little visibility in the US compared to other countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and even Canada? Sports in the United States largely reaffirm existing relations of power in society. It emphasizes consumerism, the belief that success always goes to people who merit it due to their abilities, dedication and qualifications, and reinforces, rather than changes, existing ideas related to gender, ethnicity and nationality. Paralympic sport brings attention to athletes who are typically overlooked in American society because the majority of the population does not want to identify with people who are disabled. Although disability is not contagious, interest in disabled sports might put into question the masculinity of the males following it. Disabled athletes also challenge existing relations of power by displaying dedication, hard work and perseverance in different contexts than those most sports fans are accustomed to. Other countries, including the ones you mention, have stronger social orientations in all aspects of society. Even though legislative support may be less strong than the one provided by the Americans with Disabilities Act, many social institutions including the media are more receptive to this form of diversity. What do you think the impact will be for the Paralympic movement will be with the Games being televised live in the United States for first time? The impact depends on a number of aspects. One of them is the channels that NBC as the broadcasting rights owner for the United States will use to air the Paralympic Games on. Will they be shown nationally or regionally, on NBC or on any of the company\u2019s multiple cable networks? A second aspect is the parts or hours of the day the Paralympics will be shown. Remember that there is a nine-hour difference between Sochi and New York, and a 12-hour difference between Sochi and the US West Coast. So daytime events will be shown live in the United States in the middle of the night, and evening prime-time events will be shown \u2014 indeed live \u2014 in the morning U.S. time. So showing the Paralympics live on United States television might turn out to be less glamorous than it appears. A third important factor is the way the event will be mediated: will NBC have its best sports broadcasters following the event after having worked the Winter Olympics? Will they treat and announce the competitions as they do all others \u2014 for better and worse? Will they take it as an opportunity to educate viewers about disability and diversity while showing superb athletic performances without engaging in a discourse of pity? All in all, I think this is a terrific opportunity to improve sports coverage in a multitude of aspects; but we will have to wait until after the event to assess to what extent the broadcasters will meet these expectations.", "human1": "In an interview with Wikinews, Simon Li\u010den, Assistant Professor in Educational Leadership, Sport Studies and Psychology at Washington State University, talks about the upcoming 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia, as well as the reasons for negative attitudes to the paralympics and challenges in media coverage for paralympics."}, "GUM_interview_mcguire": {"fulltext": "Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire Sunday, May 28, 2006 The LibriVox website features a catalog of about a hundred completed books, including books in other languages like German, Hebrew, and Japanese. Why did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands, and how did you go about it? I think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world, and so I thought: here's a way to help the cause. I launched LibriVox, emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff, and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent. Things have grown steadily since. By the way, AKMA was the first guy I know of to do something like this, with Lawrence Lessig's Free Culture. That, I think, started my thinking about this, but it took a while for the idea to crystallize. Hugh McGuire with some books that have not yet been acoustically liberated. Do you personally record audiobooks, and did you already do so before LibriVox? LibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks. I still do the odd chapter, but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days! Is there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality, the overall effort involved, its popularity, or for some other reason? My personal favourite is Notes from the Underground (Dostoyevsky). Other random good ones: Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice Christie, Agatha. The Mysterious Affair at Styles London, Jack. White Fang Macaulay, Thomas Babington. History of England (Volume 1, Chapter 1) Marx, Karl and Engels, Friedrich. The Communist Manifesto (solo) Twain, Mark. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (solo) Ed.: See the LibriVox catalog for a full index. Browsing the catalog, I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter. If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they didn't like the speaker, would you then offer two versions? Yes. We take the Wikipedia approach: if you think it should be better, please help it be so. You'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books. Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice: each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version, so you get 20 + versions of the same poem, a very interesting audio experience. Besides works whose copyright has expired, there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses. You mentioned Larry Lessig's Free Culture, but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept, such as O'Reilly. Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works, or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well? We are only doing public domain works, for a number of reasons, partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means its as simple as can be. CC makes things more complex. Also, there are other sites, notably podiobooks.com, which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox. we find it makes things clear and easy to say: published works, public domain, and leave it at that. As far as I can tell, podiobooks.com features \"free as in beer\" content \u2014 material which you can download, but which isn't under a free content license. Instead of \"public domain\", wouldn't \"free content\" work just as well, using something like the Free Content Definition to limit the scope? This needs more discussion obviously: we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we didn't want to add new restrictions, especially not non-commercial, since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects (I can't recall any specific project names, but some pay-education sites use LV stuff). That's good and well and fine with us. We don't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings, we want anyone to use them for whatever they want. Also, for the thing to work you need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management (onerous) and many willing to do the reading.

Wikinews caught up with her in a cafe in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Preston. [The Spitfire Tournament in Canada] was a really good tournament actually. It was a tournament that I wish we'd actually gone back to more often. Who plays in that one? It's quite a large Canadian tournament, and so we went as the Gliders team. So we were trying to get as many international games as possible. Cause that's one of our problems really, to compete. It costs us so much money to for us to travel overseas and to compete internationally. And so we can compete against each other all the time within Australia but we really need to be able to ... It's not the same. No, it's really not, so it's really important to be able to get as a many international trips throughout the year to continue our improvement. Also see where all the other teams are at as well. But yes, Spitfire was good. We took quite a few new girls over there back then in 2005, leading into the World Cup in the Netherlands. Was that the one where you were the captain of the team, in 2005? Or was that a later one? No, I captained in 2010. So 2009, 2010 World Cup. And then I had a bit of some time off in 2011. The Gliders have never won the World Championship. We always seem to have just a little bit of a chill out at the World Cup. I don't know why. It's really strange occurrence, over the years. 2002 World Cup, we won bronze. Then in 2006 we ended up fourth. It was one of the worst World Cups we've played actually. And then in 2010 we just ... I don't know what happened. We just didn't play as well as we thought we would. Came fourth. But you know what? Fired us up for the actual Paralympics. So the World Cup is ... it's good to be able to do well at the World Cup, to be placed, but it also means that you get a really good opportunity to know where you're at in that two year gap between the Paralympics. So you can come back home and revisit what you need to do and, you know, where the team's at. And all that sort of stuff.

Even though Im not Michael Jackson or somebody, when people come up to me and introduce themselves and say, 'Hey Frank, my name is John,' I say, 'Hey John, my name is Frank' and they laugh. It's a funny phenomenon. What goes through your head when that happens? I understand it. I've gone to readings and concerts. I look at it as human interaction. Over the years I have performed in 32 countries and 40 states. I've been doing this professionally since I was in my twenties, and before that since I was sixteen doing little tidbit poetry readings in coffeehouses. The band I started in 1993, Spoken Motion, received a lot of recognition as a spoken word band born out of the New York spoken word scene. I worked with some great musicians and performed around the world. I remember signing my first autograph to a kid when I was 25 years old. As time went on, I came out with books and CDs, and I became used to that kind of thing. To me, the ultimate feeling of success as an artist, is to move somebody enough where they thank you. When someone comes up and says, 'Frank, thank you, your work is great.\" You have a long career in poetry, but as of late the attention you have garnered is for the Mets-inspired work. How do you feel about having a lot of your work overshadowed by the Mets work? It's ironic. Some of the greatest poetry has been born out of failure and the depths of adversity in the human experience. Walt Whitman, the first great American poet, wrote about the Civil War. He went looking for his brother, George Whitman, after he a telegram telling him his brother was injured in the South. When he started out his poems were about beating drums, and blow, bugle, blow. Real patriotic. Then he started to see the real horrors of war. He was able to tap into the human condition and the situation at that time. Eventually when he found his brother he had resolution. I experienced that kind of adversity during 9/11 being a civilian volunteer. I loaded ferry boats in Jersey City across the river to deliver goods to Ground Zero. I turned to Whitman to find some understanding of what is happening in the world right now. When I wrote my 9/11-related poems, that was true adversity. I realize baseball is just a game. Can you recite a stanza that expresses how you feel right now? This was a piece that the Times only quoted one stanza, but it's about preparation for a battle, and being prepared to either rise to the occasion, or go down: Do you know what it's like to be chased by the Ghost of Failure while staring through Victory's door? Of course you do, you're a Mets fan caught in a do-or-die moment in late September at Shea As one thats battled hard through many a broken dream Let me say, \"in order to rise to the occasion you must be willing to go down with the ship\", Have no fear, no hesitation, for Winning shall be it's reward! Don't let them get in your head! you've kept it up this long You're a Mets fan in late September and youll fight til the glorious end Cheer the team today; (your boys in orange and blue) Let them hear you shout as they fight for what's mightily due (copyright Frank Messina; reprinted with permission)\" Sports fans aren't known as patrons of poetry. Have you had interaction with \"new readers' through your Mets work? This one person who I never met took a picture of me and sent it to me in an e-mail. The e-mail said, 'Frank, I have never bothered you during the game, but I just wanted to say thank you for your work and thank you for making some sense of the successes and failures and I wish you much success with your work.' Last year in my section at the stadium I had a banner that read We Know'. That's all it said. Then earlier this year these shirts started to come out that said, \"Poet says We Know\". It was amazing. We didn't use the banner this year, though, because we didn't know. The team wasn't so far ahead that we knew. Last year we just knew we were going to the playoffs; we knew we were going post-season. This year we weren't sure. We were walking on eggshells. There was a woman, a season ticket holder and a die hard fan. She was staggered by the loss last year to the Cardinals. Last year she came up to me during one of the games late in the season; she was so happy we were going to the post season. By that point we had clinched it. She handed me a shirt she bought at the stadium and she gave me a big hug. With tears in her eyes she said, \"Thank you, Mets Poet, thank you.\" It's cool ... it's like another family. Moments like that must make you realize you have touched people who aren't normally touched by poetry. It's opened up a new fan base, so to speak. For the last year SNY has broadcast footage of me with my poems, so quite a few fans known about the \"Mets Poet'. I have never called myself that, by the way. The back of my jersey says \"The Poet' because growing up that was my nickname. My brother was a runner and they used to call him The Birdman -- Birdie -- and they called me The Poet. It was a natural thing, but I never coined myself as 'The Mets Poet.'", "human1": "In an interview in 2007, Frank Messina, known as the 'Mets Poet', recites a stanza from one of his poems and talks about how his poetry in support of the New York Mets baseball team has touched fans of the team."}, "GUM_interview_onion": {"fulltext": "The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source' Sunday, November 25, 2007 How The Onion writes an issue This exclusive interview features first-hand journalism by a Wikinews reporter. See the collaboration page for more details. How do you decide on the stories? We do everything backwards here. We start with the headline and then flesh out the story, as opposed to The New York Times, which writes the issue and then has a headline editor to make it snappy. We start with a joke. We read about six hundred to eight hundred headline ideas on a Monday coming from our staff and a small group of writers outside \u2014 a contributing core. We whittle that down on a Monday to about a hundred, come in Tuesday and pick an issue and brainstorm with the whole editorial staff; all fifteen of us. Then we assign a headline to a specific writer to execute. We go through a number of drafts and then have the editors pick it up and assign the photojournalism aspect of it to our graphic design team, who adds the visual aspect to it. The editors punch it up over the last couple of days and then it goes out over the Internet and into the print edition. So you don\u2019t have writers coming up with a story and headline, but you will instead have a team of writers choosing the best headlines and then assign it to a particular writer who was not necessarily involved? Writers will occasionally write their own headlines, but we come up with a list of 15 or 20 headline ideas, what we think will make a good story and then we assign it based upon what people\u2019s writing strengths are. We have some people who are great at politics; some people we give all the war stuff to; someone who is in charge of the Britney Spears story of the week \u2014 the entertainment stories. The headlines Editorial Manager Chet Clem and President Sean Mills. Image: David Shankbone It seems like some publications, like AM New York, always have a Britney Spears story; is there anything similar with The Onion where they continually revisit a topic or person? No, not necessarily. We are a little less reactionary. We tend to target the zeitgeist more than anything. We\u2019ll hit the mainstream media\u2019s portrayal of the entertainment world as much as we\u2019ll hit characters in the entertainment world. We\u2019ll attack People Magazine\u2019s coverage of Britney as much as Britney. In an interview with Terry Gross, Stephen Colbert said of his time at Second City that they had decided on not doing political humor and, in particular, hackneyed political humor such as Ted Kennedy drinking jokes. They felt it was overdone, mean-spirited and not funny. Do your writers have similar rules of thumb? We don\u2019t have any rules or known lines we won\u2019t cross. We have an understanding based upon having the same writers in the back room for years, and those writers training the new writers as they come in. There is an understanding in the room. If it makes the room laugh, it probably ends up in the paper. One example is we ran an article a couple of years back that was, \"No Jennifer Lopez News Today\". That was our reaction to all of the J-Lo stuff. We weren\u2019t going to touch on her dress, or who she was dating. Just the fact that those were the lead stories for so many days, in everything from US Weekly to Time Magazine. I think it\u2019s important we have an original take on those things. I think it\u2019s similar to what Colbert said to Terry Gross. We don\u2019t want to just traffic in the same 24 hour news cycle. There\u2019s a 24 hour comedy news cycle that exists on all the late night talk shows. The Onion has a different creative process where we are not trying to hit everything in the 24 hours and on the same notes. We want an original take. If we choose to do something on J-Lo, it\u2019s going to be something like that, something less obvious. When you are going through the headlines, is it just you guys sitting around trying to crack each other up? It\u2019s the least amount of fun possible. Nah, I\u2019m kidding. It\u2019s actually more businesslike than you\u2019d imagine. It\u2019s very much like you are trying to make the room laugh, but the room has been a sort of captive audience for many many years now, so it takes a lot to make the room laugh. The best analogy I\u2019ve heard is when Rob Siegel, former editor-in-chief, likened it to wine tasting. It\u2019s this quiet experience where you are trying to soak in what the joke is, have we done anything like this, is it a unique take, what are other people doing.

The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for.\" Shimon Peres image: David Shankbone. Mr. President, as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel, do you still think that there is a future to the peace process? The future is only peace. The problem is how long will it take and how many victims will it call for. Why do I say peace? Because when you look historically, at the development of humanity, most of our lives we are living on the land. The history is written with red ink. The reason for it is because people were fighting for our land, either defending it or extending it, because that was the main source. The land, the natural resources, the markets, all these go together. The minute the land was replaced by science, what is there to fight about? Armies cannot conquer science. Customs cannot check what a scientist has in his mind, they can see what he has in his pocket but not what he has in his mind so it\u2019s uncontrolled; it means that borders aren\u2019t important and distances aren\u2019t important. How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when, in the end, they don\u2019t want Israel to exist. How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible? Well, what is the problem? I mean, is the problem national, say between Jews and Arabs; or is it a matter of generations between an old age and a new age? You see, the terrorists are protesting against modernity. They think that modernity may endanger their tradition. They are simply afraid and hate modernity. They consider modernity as their enemy, but then they have two problems. First of all, can they exist on tradition? They cannot. Sooner or later they will have to enter the new age. All the talks about nationalities, etcetera, well, the new age has very little patience for history. History is becoming more and more irrelevant. How do you feel about that? Well, I distinguish between two histories, the spiritual and the material. Or the history of events and the history of values. The history of values is okay because wisdom is ageless; it doesn\u2019t grow old, like material. But events are totally unimportant for 2 reasons. First, the event is unimportant. Tell me, what events is today important such as how many elephants Hannibal had on the Alps, when you can have helicopters? Why should I bother my children with all this nonsense? What sort of a nose did Cleopatra have? God, I don\u2019t know! You can invite people to war over noses, but nobody will go to fight for noses any more. On the other hand, there are already machines that can replace our memory. Why should I bother my child with memory when he can buy a computer that will remember everything you asked him to remember? The waning importance of history Isn\u2019t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory? Although a computer can have \u2026 No, no. Forget memory. Look, the new age is unprecedented. When something is unprecedented, it means it doesn\u2019t have a past, doesn\u2019t have a history. It\u2019s totally oriented on the future. And whoever dwells in the past, doesn\u2019t understand the future because the past is full of prejudices, of commitments. It arrests us. And then you say you won\u2019t commit a mistake, so you\u2019ll commit new mistakes. It doesn\u2019t matter. `` I say brains is the greater producer of wealth, not oil. It\u2019s limitless, and you\u2019ll see that the GNP of Israel is very close to the Saudis\u2019. So they are 3 times larger than us and they have all the oil in the world. We have brains.\" \u2014 Peres, on whether the Arab states' oil wealth will eclipse Israel's prominence in the region. What about the adage, \u201cThose who forget history are doomed to repeat it\u201d? So they will make new mistakes. Mistake is inevitable as long as there are human beings. But you cannot repeat mistakes because the world is not built on repetition; it\u2019s built on mutation. Don\u2019t you think Darfur is repetition? I think Darfur is, again, the last, or among the last battles between old and new. What are they fighting for? What are they killing killing killing over? They don\u2019t carry futures. It\u2019s not a mistake. It belongs to a past. It doesn\u2019t have a moment. I am sure that the reasons for war are over, even though still there are wars which are an inertia from the past, a continuation that doesn\u2019t make sense. I\u2019m answering your question. The problem is how to enable the whole world to enter the new future, including the Arabs. And there are already Arabs who did it. Look at Turkey, who is knocking on the doors of the united Europe. Why? It\u2019s not a geographic endeavor, it is an intellectual endeavor.

Currently Shalev is a Professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Einstein Institute of Mathematics. At the moment Shalev is in Levico Terme, Trento, Italy for a conference. He was interviewed by Wikinews. Interview Aner Shalev What are you going to talk about here in Levico? I called it Character, walks and words. There is a whole topic which is called asymptotic groups theory. There are groups which express the symmetry of some structures. Studying groups is a bit like studying symmetry. It's very beautiful I think. And then when you do it in an asymptotic way is like you don't look at the small details. It's like from the sky. You look at the general patterns. And there is another topic which is very important in mathematics which is called representation theory. So I will mainly talk about how to use a representation theory to solve all kind of problems and conjectures in asymptotic groups theory. Why did you choose to study mathematics? First of all because it was beautiful. When I was ten my father already showed me some stuff in mathematics and the beauty and the imagination was quite apparent. I also like the freedom in mathematics. If you study physics or chemistry then you should describe the real world. But in mathematics you can build your own structures. You can walk in worlds created by the imagination of people. You're not committed to the real world. It's almost like God to some extent. You can create worlds, you can study them. I think it's a combination of the beauty, of the imagination, of the freedom. Many people, and many students, dislike math. Why do you think it is so? First of all I think maybe they have bad teachers, which is a problem. You have to have very good teachers in mathematics if you really want to enjoy and to succeed in it. Probably some people mainly think about the scientific part of it \u2013 you have to be accurate - and they see less these elements of the freedom, and the imagination, and creation. Maybe they don't like the precise nature of mathematics. Also when I talk mathematics I notice the language is very important in mathematics and I actually notice that many times people fail in mathematics because they don't know how to write a composition. They have ideas but they cannot formulate them in the right way. Actually I find many connections between mathematics and literature because almost all the thing I told about mathematics are also seen in literature and in writing because when you write you can describe the real world, but you can also create worlds of fiction. So you have imagination, you have total freedom, you can invent characters, you can invent all kind of development and surprises and this kind of end of story or another. Also the language is important in writing and in literature. So in a way people often don't know how to combine the two fields. It could look like almost the opposite: literature is kind of arts and mathematics is science but they also see a lot in common and there where mathematician who were writers. For example the most famous is Lewis Carrol, author of Alice in Wonderland. You're not only a mathematician. You also wrote two collections of short stories and a novel. Why did you begin to write? When I was quite young I was interested in psychoanalysis and in dreams. I was trying to interpret my dreams. I started to write down my dreams. And then I noticed that I cheat a little bit when I write them down. Sometimes I make them more pretty then they were actually. So instead of documenting the dreams it gradually became also like adding creational elements, and I think that somehow through writing my dreams I gradually came to writing, also poems, but mainly stories. I'm a little bit inspired by dreams but when eventually I started to write more seriously I was more interested in structure which also .. a bit like mathematics in a way .. for example my first book is called Opus 1 .. a collection of four long stories with musical structures. The first part is called Legato and the second part was called Staccato. In the legato part the sentences are very long and without breaks almost like stream of consciousness. In the staccato part it's like a music: a lot of break, very very short sentences. It was a bit experimenting connections between the language and the music and the psychology of people. In the second book I made another experiment. It's a book of opening, Overtures I called it, and there is no end to the stories. There are seventy beginning of stories without ends. In the novel Dark Matters I think what interested me in the structure was two thing: simple narrative and email. It keeps changing between narrative and email. Another thing was two different time scapes: one goes very slow and one goes very fast and they almost kind of meet in the end. It's a little bit like Achilles and the turtle. ... love story and romance and surprises and tragedies and all this but also this structure interested me a lot. Why did you choose this particular structure? When I tell stories I don't like that everything will be clear from the beginning. I like that something will be a bit of secret, or even unreliable narrator: someone tells something and first you trust him but then you read more and you become thrilled by everything. I think by using emails on the one hand which are more the voice of the woman Eva and narrative which is more the perspective of the man Adam, I kind of confront them, their different perspective and then kind somehow you can see the distortions in the way the story is told. I think that in this kind of structure there is a very gradual clarification of the relationship and the forth going on.", "human1": "In an interview, mathematician and writer Aner Shalev tells Wikinews about the origins of his love for mathematics, how analyzing his own dreams got him into creative writing, and two of his books, a collection of stories called Opus 1, and a novel called Dark Matters."}, "GUM_interview_stardust": {"fulltext": "Keep your eyes peeled for cosmic debris: Andrew Westphal about Stardust @ home Sunday, May 28, 2006 Stardust is a NASA space capsule that collected samples from comet 81P/Wild (also known as \"Wild 2) in deep space and landed back on Earth on January 15, 2006. It was decided that a collaborative online review process would be used to \"discover\" the microscopically small samples the capsule collected. The project is called Stardust @ home. Unlike distributed computing projects like SETI @ home, Stardust @ home relies entirely on human intelligence. Andrew Westphal is the director of Stardust @ home. Wikinews interviewed him for May's Interview of the Month (IOTM) on May 18, 2006. As always, the interview was conducted on IRC, with multiple people asking questions. Some may not know exactly what Stardust or Stardust @ home is. Can you explain more about it for us? Artist's rendering of Spacecraft Stardust Image: NASA Stardust is a NASA Discovery mission that was launched in 1999. It is really two missions in one. The primary science goal of the mission was to collect a sample from a known primitive solar-system body, a comet called Wild 2 (pronounced \"Vilt-two\" \u2014 the discoverer was German, I believe). This is the first US \"sample return\" mission since Apollo, and the first ever from beyond the moon. This gives a little context. By \"sample return\" of course I mean a mission that brings back extraterrestrial material. I should have said above that this is the first \"solid\" sample return mission \u2014 Genesis brought back a sample from the Sun almost two years ago, but Stardust is also bringing back the first solid samples from the local interstellar medium \u2014 basically this is a sample of the Galaxy. This is absolutely unprecedented, and we're obviously incredibly excited. I should mention parenthetically that there is a fantastic launch video \u2014 taken from the POV of the rocket on the JPL Stardust website \u2014 highly recommended \u2014 best I've ever seen \u2014 all the way from the launch pad, too. Basically interplanetary trajectory. Absolutely great. Is the video available to the public? Yes [see below]. OK, I digress. The first challenge that we have before can do any kind of analysis of these interstellar dust particles is simply to find them. This is a big challenge because they are very small (order of micron in size) and are somewhere (we don't know where) on a HUGE collector \u2014 at least on the scale of the particle size \u2014 about a tenth of a square meter. So ... We're right now using an automated microscope that we developed several years ago for nuclear astrophysics work to scan the collector in the Cosmic Dust Lab in Building 31 at Johnson Space Center. This is the ARES group that handles returned samples (Moon Rocks, Genesis chips, Meteorites, and Interplanetary Dust Particles collected by U2 in the stratosphere). The microscope collects stacks of digital images of the aerogel collectors in the array. These images are sent to us \u2014 we compress them and convert them into a format appropriate for Stardust @ home. Stardust @ home is a highly distributed project using a \"Virtual Microscope\" that is written in html and javascript and runs on most browsers \u2014 no downloads are required. Using the Virtual Microscope volunteers can search over the collector for the tracks of the interstellar dust particles. Aerogel slice removed with an ultrasonic blade, showing particle tracks. Image: NASA How many samples do you anticipate being found during the course of the project? Great question. The short answer is that we don't know. The long answer is a bit more complicated. Here's what we know. The Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft carried dust detectors onboard that Eberhard Gruen and his colleagues used to first detect and them measure the flux of interstellar dust particles streaming into the solar system. (This is a kind of \"wind\" of interstellar dust, caused by the fact that our solar system is moving with respect to the local interstellar medium.) Markus Landgraf has estimated the number of interstellar dust particles that should have been captured by Stardust during two periods of the \"cruise\" phase of the interplanetary orbit in which the spacecraft was moving with this wind. He estimated that there should be around 45 particles, but this number is very uncertain \u2014 I wouldn't be surprised if it is quite different from that. That was the long answer! One thing that I should say ... is that like all research, the outcome of what we are doing is highly uncertain. There is a wonderful quote attributed to Einstein \u2014 \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called \"research\", would it?\" How big would the samples be? We expect that the particles will be of order a micron in size. (A millionth of a meter.) When people are searching using the virtual microscope, they will be looking not for the particles, but for the tracks that the particles make, which are much larger \u2014 several microns in diameter. Just yesterday we switched over to a new site which has a demo of the VM (virtual microscope) I invite you to check it out. The tracks in the demo are from submicron carbonyl iron particles that were shot into aerogel using a particle accelerator modified to accelerate dust particles to very high speeds, to simulate the interstellar dust impacts that we're looking for.

The six - member Afghan team, which consists entirely of girls, had been denied visas to enter the United States until last week, drawing notice from critics of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies regarding Muslims traveling to the U.S. The President later personally took action to allow the team into the country. According to Afghan Ambassador to the United States Hamdullah Mohib, the participation of this team in this science competition shows progress in Afghanistan's response to nearly two decades of military conflict. The first FIRST Global robotics competition was held this week in Washington D.C. Image: United States Navy. The FIRST Global competition (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technlogy) was founded by Dean Kamen to encourage interest in applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in young people. This year's theme was water security. For the contest, the robots were required to recognize, pick up, carry, and deposit balls colored blue and orange to represent water and pollution, respectively. Teams from different countries were arranged in groups of three, and groups faced off in pairs. The group whose three robots collectively earned the most points won that match. According to the Afghan team's coach, Alireza Mehraban, in their first matchup, the Afghan team's robot, named \"Better Idea of Afghan Girls,\" scored one or two points for the three-nation alliance with the Gabonese and Estonian teams. This year, the European team won the competition overall, with the silver medal going to Poland and the bronze to Armenia. \"We are so interested because we find a big chance to show the talent and ability of Afghans,\" team member Rodaba Noori told the press, \"to show that Afghan women can make robots too and we can improve in this section \u2014 [the] robotics section. We were so interested because we hadn't long or enough time to get ready for competition but we came to United States and now we are here because of Trump intervention.\" The team arrived in Washington D.C. after many difficulties. They were twice denied visas to enter the United States. Even applying for a visa required the entire team to travel about 500 miles (800 km) from Herat, their home, to the capital in Kabul, through territory controlled by the Taliban. They made the trip twice and were turned down both times. President Donald Trump personally asked the United States National Security Council to help the girls enter the country. After some interplay between the State and Homeland Security Departments, the girls were granted \"parole\" status on the grounds that their entry would be a \"significant public benefit.\" The President has drawn both praise for helping the girls enter the U.S. and criticism for his travel ban, which does not cover Afghanistan, and for the atmosphere of hostility toward Muslims that critics blame for denying them entry in the first place. Citing privacy rules, U.S. officials have not said why the team was initially denied visas, but Afghan Ambassador Hamdullah Mohib says there were concerns they would attempt to remain in the United States or in Canada after the contest. Afghanistan is not one of the nations covered by President Trump's travel ban, but teams from Sudan, Iran, Libya, and Yemen, which are covered, are among the 163 teams in the competition. There were also two Syrian teams scheduled to compete, one national and one made up of refugees. Syria and all refugees are covered by the ban. The Syrian refugee team listed their country as \"Hope\" on the backs of their shirts and named their robot \"Robogee.\" Teams from Morocco and Iran both had difficulties getting themselves or their robots across the U.S. border. Team Estonia had to rebuild their robot entirely after the original disappeared in transit. \"Seventeen years ago, this would not have been possible at all,\" said Ambassador Mohib. \"They represent our aspirations and resilience despite having been brought up in a perpetual conflict. These girls will be proving to the world and the nation that nothing will prevent us from being an equal and active member of the international community.\" Every team in the contest was sent a collection of robot parts roughly four months in advance of the competition. The Afghan team's supplies were delayed, leaving them only two weeks left to assemble their robot and only one day to test it before packing it up to mail to the competition site.

Montalvo is holding a copy of the book Blown for Good critical of Scientology, written by Marc Headley. Image: Mark Rathbun. Daniel Montalvo, 19, a member of Scientology all his life, was arrested after leaving its elite group the Sea Org. He was released on US$ 20,000 bail on Thursday. Montalvo was charged with taking hard drives and a zip drive from the Scientology organization after leaving the Sea Org group. The Sea Org requires members to sign a billion-year-contract, agreeing to work for the organization founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard for multiple lifetimes. Members of the Sea Org live a strict lifestyle \u2013 with little income, small diet provided and significant time invested in work per day. Montalvo had read an article in the Scientology propaganda publication Freedom Magazine, which attacked high-ranking defectors from the organization including Tom Devocht and Mark Rathbun. Montalvo had known Devocht personally, and came to the conclusion that the claims made about him in the Freedom article were lies. Montalvo was subsequently motivated to seek out information about Scientology on the Internet, and came upon a blog written by Rathbun. Montalvo contacted former members of Scientology, who helped him leave the organization and get in touch with Devocht. He traveled to Florida to meet with Devocht, who had told Montalvo he would assist him with future employment and housing. According to Rathbun the Scientology property in question was returned by mail to the organization by Montalvo shortly after he left the Sea Org. Scientology officials have stated they have not received the materials. After calling the Scientology organization by phone to attempt to speak with his mother, Montalvo was instead put through to a Scientology attorney, Kendrick Moxon.

Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals including Social Science & Medicine have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery. An example of severe eczema. Image: Jambula. Gloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist. Thomas Sam, a practising homeopath, instead decided to treat his daughter himself. His daughter's condition deteriorated, to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin, leading to severe malnutrition and, eventually, her death. By the end, Gloria's eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy, and in the words of the Crown prosecutor, Mark Tedeschi, QC, \"Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying, irritable, scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother's breast.\" Gloria also became unable to move her legs. Mr. Tedeschi also told the court that, over the last five months of her life, \"Gloria's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other.\" However, despite their child's severe illness, and her lack of improvement, the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment, instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths. Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments, but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy, and she consistently worsened. Allegedly, Thomas' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor, but he replied \"I am not able to do that\". The parents are also accused of putting their social life ahead of their child, taking her on a trip to India and leaving her to servants while embarking on a busy social schedule, and giving her homeopathic drops instead of using the prescription creams they had been given. Gloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death. By this time, \"her skin was weeping, her body malnourished and her corneas melting\", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Speaking in the parents' defense, Tom Molomby, SC, said that, as the parents came from India, where homeopathy is in common use, they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences. Homeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person undiluted, would cause symptoms similar to the disease. Typical treatments take the dilutions, with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution, past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain; for homeopathic treatments to work, basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong.

A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian school children has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation. The report's authors say iodine deficiency is \"the sleeper health issue in Australia\", and potentially a very serious one. The results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week, revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient. The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised. They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders. A cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8\u201310 years, from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, between July 2003 and December 2004. Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread, is ongoing. The authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population. They call for \"urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia.\" Most iodine in food comes from seafood, milk and iodised salt. Professor Cres Eastman, Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study, and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine. Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, stunted growth and deafness. Professor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries. \"I suspect they won't do that on a voluntary basis, we've tried so far and haven't succeeded, so we've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand | that all salt should be iodised,\" he said. The report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry, where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers. Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades, but is now declining. Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods. The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods. Professor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised. He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt. \"The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs. So if we go to the pregnant woman, she doesn't get enough iodine, she won't make enough thyroid hormone, and the foetus won't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain, so you'll then see consequences being loss of IQ, learning difficulties, hearing difficulties and other neurological problems,\" Professor Eastman said. \"If an infant's not getting enough iodine ... brain development won't be completed and they won't grow normally, and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid won't function as well as it should, so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life.\" More than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency, and yet the problem is easily fixed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt. The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism, a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life. WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world\u2019s most prevalent, yet easily preventable, cause of brain damage. Professor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found. \"Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis. So that alarms me, because there's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country,\" he said. \"If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points, on average. There shouldn't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia.\" Lydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year. She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right. We need to \"make sure there's sufficient iodine added into the food supply, to help those people with a deficiency. But at the other end of the scale we've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people don't get too much and get overdose,\" Ms Bauchtman said. \"One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking.\" Senior researcher Mu Li, of the University of NSW's school of public health, said \"it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient, putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency.\"", "human1": "A 2006 Australian study has shown that almost half of all Australian children suffer from mild iodine deficiency, which can cause health problems especially for children and pregnant women, and is probably due to the replacement of iodine-containing sanitisers in the dairy industry and the lack of iodized salt in Australia."}, "GUM_news_korea": {"fulltext": "North Korea puts military in 'quasi-state of war' Friday, August 21, 2015 According to Yonhap news agency, quoting North Korea's main news agency Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the country's military has been placed on high alert and has been told to prepare a \"quasi-state of war\".

The centerpiece of this rock concert-like performance is a 15 meter high rotating pig equipped with a fog machine, laser light show and theme music. The theme of this years lantern festival revolves around the 12 year Chinese zodiac cycles year of the pig. Its round shape symbolizes wealth and good fortune and is believed to bring good luck. Started in 1990, the Taipei lantern festival continues a 2000 year old tradition of light related festivals marking the end of the Chinese New Year celebrations. This particular event grows in popularity every year. Last Year over 4 million visitors attended the event and this year the city expects about 6 million visitors according to the event website. Colorful lantern scenes not only fill the central square but also the surrounding 2 km circumference of the memorial. Each section has a theme. One side of the memorial is scenes made by student groups while other areas represent the counties of Taiwan. There is even a section of lanterns sponsored by foreign countries. The Malaysia Tourism board was quite prominent at the main entrance to the grounds. As with all new year celebrations in Taiwan, the lantern festival is crowded. People flock to see the lantern scenes and enjoy the festival atmosphere as they carry lanterns, given away by the city and bought from street vendors at the event. The many light toys such a swords, devil ears, and lanterns turn the milling crowd into a unique light show that can be observed by climbing the steps of the 70 meter memorial hall on the grounds. Local public transportation hubs are often swamped by the event. The station staff at Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall Station do an excellent job of crowd control but lines for the subway can still be hours long and very exhausting. A sudden rain storm on Sunday night (March 4) caused a mass exodus of people to head for the station prompting lines that backed up into the street. The commuting crowds can be avoided however by walking from NTU Hospital Station or Shandao Station. Both of these stops are only about a 20 minute walk from the event and have no crowds at all. If you really want to avoid the crowds, definitely avoid the weekends. Wait until the fourth or fifth day of the festival when the crowds will have dwindled. I visited the festival on Saturday night, the opening night, and there was a sea of people in the square.

Instituto Gonzaga, a catholic school in Milan. Image: Friedrichstrasse. The request of the municipalities results from the sentence of the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation on July 8, recognising as legitimate the request of the Municipality of Livorno asking religious schools to pay property taxes. Requests have come from the Municipality of Bogliasco, next to Genova, and from the deputies of Movimento 5 Stelle (M5S) of the regional counsel of Lombardy. The first case is of the mayor Luca Pastorino that in last years received several refusals of his requests for payment because of the religious nursery school and retirement home. In the second case, the M5S party asks to the regional government to assure the local administrations of the region regularly apply the sentence of the Supreme Court. The case on which the Court has ruled was of the religious schools Santo Spirito and Immacolata in Livorno, Tuscany, to pay over 422,000 euros in arrears for the period from 2004 to 2009. The request was advanced by the Municipality of Livorno in 2010. The city reasoned, \"because the users of the private schools pay a frequency fee, this kind of activity is considered as a commercial one\" ((it)). In 2014 the Italian municipal tax discipline has changed from the ICI system to the IMU system by the Monti government. A mean cost per student criterion is used to tax only the schools that receive a fee higher than the mean cost per student fixed by the State. The new law is not retroactive, so the taxes requested in arrears from 2006 to 2009 are under the ICI system. Minister of Education Stefania Giannini said a \"more general reflection\" ((it)) is needed. Claudio De Vincenti, undersecretary to the prime minister, said \"a discussion table will be opened with the non-profit associations, religious association included\" ((it)). Undersecretary for Education Mr. Toccafondi says \"many schools will increase their fees or they will quit. Then the State will have to find new resources to build new structures and manage them\" ((it)). Also the president of the Lombardy region, Roberto Maroni, has reacted by proposing some regional counter-measures to finance private schools. The secretary general of CEI (Italian Episcopal Conference), Nunzio Galantino, has called the sentence \"dangerous\" ((it)) and \"ideological\" ((it)): \"We face a dangerous sentence. Who takes the decisions, do it with less ideology. Because I have the clear sensation that with this way of thinking, they wait the praise of some ideologized supporters. Indeed, they don't understand what kind of good service private schools held\" ((it)). Italian secularist associations are concerned the Government will modify the law in order to maintain an exception for religious schools. The secularist magazine MicroMega describe the court's judgement as historic. The Union of Rationalist Atheists and Agnostics (UAAR) has launched a petition which now has more than 11,000 signatures, asking the government to respect and execute the sentence of the Supreme Court. It is also encouraging citizens to ask for application of the law in their local municipalities.", "human1": "A July 2015 decision by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation ruling that religious schools must pay property taxes in Livorno has led to other municipalities in Bogliasco and Lombardy seeking retroactive tax payments from their religious schools, which opponents warn may cause fee increases or school closures."}, "GUM_news_warhol": {"fulltext": "Warhol's photo legacy spread by university exhibits Tuesday, January 28, 2014 Portrait shot of Dennis Hopper, famous for his role in the 1969 film Easy Rider, amongst the Warhol Polaroids donated to USI by the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

Evansville, Indiana, United States - This past week marked the opening night of an Andy Warhol exhibit at the University of Southern Indiana. USI's art gallery, like 189 other educational galleries and museums around the country, is a recipient of a major Warhol donor program, and this program is cultivating new interest in Warhol's photographic legacy. Wikinews reporters attended the opening and spoke to donors, exhibit organizers and patrons. The USI art gallery celebrated the Thursday opening with its display of Warhol's Polaroids, gelatin silver prints and several colored screen prints. USI's exhibit, which is located in Evansville, Indiana, is to run from January 23 through March 9. Full interview with Kristin Wilkins, curator of the exhibition at the University of Southern Indiana. Audio: Jkthom. The McCutchan Art Center / Pace Galleries at USI bases its exhibit around roughly 100 Polaroids selected from its collection. The Polaroids were all donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program, according to Kristen Wilkins, assistant professor of photography and curator of the exhibit. The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts made two donations to USI Art Collections, in 2007 and a second recently. Kathryn Waters, director of the gallery, expressed interest in further donations from the foundation in the future. Since 2007 the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program has seeded university art galleries throughout the United States with over 28,000 Andy Warhol photographs and other artifacts. The program takes a decentralized approach to Warhol's photography collection and encourages university art galleries to regularly disseminate and educate audiences about Warhol's artistic vision, especially in the area of photography.

Wilkins observed that the 2007 starting date of the donation program, which is part of the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, coincided with the 20th anniversary of Andy Warhol's death in 1987. USI was not alone in receiving a donation. K.C. Maurer, chief financial officer and treasurer at the Andy Warhol Foundation, said 500 institutions received the initial invitation and currently 190 universities have accepted one or more donations. Institutional recipients, said Mauer, are required to exhibit their donated Warhol photographs every ten years as one stipulation. While USI is holding its exhibit, there are also Warhol Polaroid exhibits at the Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York and an Edward Steichen and Andy Warhol exhibit at the Mary & Leigh Block Museum of Art at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. All have received Polaroids from the foundation. University exhibits can reach out and attract large audiences. For example, the Weatherspoon Art Museum at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro saw attendance levels reach 11,000 visitors when it exhibited its Warhol collection in 2010, according to curator Elaine Gustafon. That exhibit was part of a collaboration combining the collections from Duke University, located in Durham, North Carolina, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which also were recipients of donated items from the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program. Superstars Each collection donated by the Andy Warhol Photographic Legacy Program holds Polaroids of well-known celebrities. The successful UNC Greensboro exhibit included Polaroids of author Truman Capote and singer-songwriter Carly Simon. \"I think America's obsession with celebrity culture is as strong today as it was when Warhol was living\", said Gustafon. \"People are still intrigued by how stars live, dress and socialize, since it is so different from most people's every day lives.\" Wilkins explained Warhol's obsession with celebrities began when he first collected head shots as a kid and continued as a passion throughout his life. \"He's hanging out with the celebrities, and has kind of become the same sort of celebrity he was interested in documenting earlier in his career\", Wilkins said. The exhibit at USI includes Polaroids of actor Dennis Hopper; musician Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran; publishers Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone Magazine and Carlo De Benedetti of Italy's la Repubblica; disco club owner Steve Rubell of Studio 54; photographers Nat Finkelstein, Christopher Makos and Felice Quinto; and athletes Vitas Gerulaitis (tennis) and Jack Nicklaus (golf). Wikinews observed the USI exhibit identifies and features Polaroids of fashion designer Halston, a former resident of Evansville. University collections across the United States also include Polaroids of \"unknowns\" who have not yet had their fifteen minutes of fame. Cynthia Thompson, curator and director of exhibits at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, said, \"These images serve as documentation of people in his every day life and art - one which many of us enjoy a glimpse into.\" Warhol's photographic legacy Warhol was close to important touchstones of the 1960s, including art, music, consumer culture, fashion, and celebrity worship, which were all buzzwords and images Wikinews observed at USI's opening exhibit. He was also an influential figure in the pop art movement. \"Pop art was about what popular American culture really thought was important\", Kathryn Waters said. \"That's why he did the Campbell Soup cans or the Marilyn pictures, these iconic products of American culture whether they be in film, video or actually products we consumed. So even back in the sixties, he was very aware of this part of our culture. Which as we all know in 2014, has only increased probably a thousand fold.\" \"I think everybody knows Andy Warhol's name, even non-art people, that's a name they might know because he was such a personality\", Water said. Hilary Braysmith, USI associate professor of art history, said, \"I think his photography is equally influential as his graphic works, his more famous pictures of Marilyn. In terms of the evolution of photography and experimentation, like painting on them or the celebrity fascination, I think he was really ground-breaking in that regard.\" The Polaroid format is not what made Warhol famous, however, he is in the company of other well-known photographers who used the camera, such as Ansel Adams, Chuck Close, Walker Evans, Robert Mapplethorpe, and Helmut Newton. Wilkins said,\" [Warhol] liked the way photo booths and the Polaroid's front flash looked\". She explained how Warhol's adoption of the Polaroid camera revealed his process. According to Wilkins, Warhol was able to reproduce the Polaroid photograph and create an enlargement of it, which he then could use to commit the image to the silk screen medium by applying paint or manipulating them further. One of the silk screens exhibited at USI this time was the Annie Oakley screen print called \"Cowboys and Indians\" from 1987. Wilkins also said Warhol was both an artist and a businessperson. \"As a way to commercialize his work, he would make a blue Marilyn and a pink Marilyn and a yellow Marilyn, and then you could pick your favorite color and buy that. It was a very practical salesman approach to his work. He was very prolific but very business minded about that.\" \"He wanted to be rich and famous and he made lots of choices to go that way\", Wilkins said. USI exhibit Kiara Perkins, a second year USI art major, admitted she was willing to skip class Thursday night to attend the opening exhibit but then circumstances allowed for her to attend the exhibit. Why did she so badly want to attend? \"It's Warhol. He is a legend.\" For Kevin Allton, a USI instructor in English, Warhol was also a legend. He said, \"Andy Warhol was the center of the Zeitgeist for the 20th century and everything since. He is a post-modern diety.\" Allton said he had only seen the Silver Clouds installation before in film. The Silver Clouds installation were silver balloons blown up with helium, and those balloons filled one of the smaller rooms in the gallery. \"I thought that in real life it was really kind of magical,\" Allton said. \"I smacked them around.\" Elements of the Zeitgeist were also playfully recreated on USI's opening night. In her opening remarks for attendees, Waters pointed out those features to attendees, noting the touches of the Warhol Factory, or the studio where he worked, that were present around them. She pointed to the refreshment table with Campbell's Soup served with \"electric\" Kool Aid and tables adorned with colorful gumball \"pills\". The music in the background was from such bands as The Velvet Underground. The big hit of the evening, Wikinews observed from the long line, was the Polaroid-room where attendees could wear a Warhol-like wig or don crazy glasses and have their own Polaroid taken. The Polaroids were ready in an instant and immediately displayed at the entry of the exhibit. Exhibit goers then became part of the very exhibit they had wanted to attend. In fact, many people Wikinews observed took out their mobiles as they left for the evening and used their own phone cameras to make one further record of the moment - a photo of a photo. Perhaps they had learned an important lesson from the Warhol exhibit that cultural events like these were ripe for use and reuse. We might even call these exit instant snap shots, the self selfie.", "human1": "A new exhibit of Andy Warhol's Polaroids and prints at the University of Southern Indiana is running from January 23 to March 9, 2014, featuring roughly 100 polaroids donated by the Andy Warhol Foundation, an installation of balloons called Silver Clouds, an installation taking Polaroid pictures of visitors, and Warhol themed food and music."}, "GUM_news_warming": {"fulltext": "Scientists analyse effects of global warming, atmospheric ozone on crops Monday, July 28, 2014 A research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Colorado State University of the US and the University of Sheffield of the UK has analysed effects of global warming and ozone pollution over 2000 - 2050 on the worldwide production of wheat, rice, maize and soybean. The study was published in journal Nature Climate Change yesterday. The scientists found reduction of crop yields by 2050 exceeded 10% of 2000 levels, substantially decreasing food security, in all cases examined. Several scenarios were considered because of uncertainty of future levels of ozone pollution. They estimated by 2050, increasing population and changing diet would increase world food needs by 50 percent. As coauthor Colette Heald told The Huffington Post, \"The climate projections are quite consistent [...] the future of ozone pollution is very different [...] leading to either offsetting or reinforcing effects [of climate change] on crops\". By 2050, undernourishment would increase by either 49 percent or by 27 percent, depending on the scenario. The study focuses on ozone-temperature covariation: ground-level ozone increases with temperatures. Heald said although temperature and ozone are separately known to impact crop yields, \"nobody has looked at these together\". Depending on region and crops, the yields may be primarily sensitive to ozone - in the case of wheat - or heat - in the case of maize - alone, providing a local estimation of relative benefits of climate change adaptation versus ozone regulation. The U.S. Department of Agriculture notes, \"Ground-level ozone causes more damage to plants than all other air pollutants combined\", highlighting the importance of air quality for agriculture. Results of NCLAN studies, published in a paper by AS Heagle in 1989, show dicot species, such as soybean, cotton, and peanut, lose more yield from ozone than do monocot species such as sorghum, field corn, and winter wheat. The researchers found that ozone pollution caused 46 percent of previously heat-attributed damage to soybean crops. The model does not include the effect of rising carbon dioxide concentration, which has complex and potentially offsetting impacts on global food supply. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says some crops may have higher yields with increased levels of carbon dioxide. However, global warming also increases probability of extreme crops-damaging weather events such as floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures. Climate change affects distribution of weeds, pests, and diseases. Heald noted the findings show pollution reduction is also important. \"An air-quality cleanup would improve crop yields [...] Ozone is something that we understand the causes of, and the steps that need to be taken to improve air quality.\" As Heald told The Huffington Post, US surface ozone has dropped partly due to the Clean Air Act. \"Despite an increase in vehicle miles driven and energy consumption, surface ozone has declined by 25 percent on average across the U.S. from 1980 to 2012 [...] However, the future of ozone air quality in the U.S. and around the world will depend on local emissions, the use of pollution control technology, regulations, and air quality policy.\" The study was supported by the Croucher Foundation, US National Science Foundation, and US National Park Service.", "human1": "In a study published on July 27, 2014 in the journal Nature Climate Change, scientists have forecast a substantial reduction of wheat, rice, maize and soybean crop yields by 2050 due to climate change and ozone pollution, leading to global undernourishment levels of 27\u201349%."}, "GUM_news_worship": {"fulltext": "Greek court rules worship of ancient Greek deities is legal Monday, March 27, 2006 Greek court has ruled that worshippers of the ancient Greek religion may now formally associate and worship at archeological sites.

While it seems suspicious that Bobby wins so many of the competitions (leading many to think that the show is rigged), I have a feeling that Bobby's record is a product of selective casting. To explain: Remember when Anne Burrell challenged Bobby to a cheesecake battle, and won? Anne admitted it\u2019s not her favorite dish, but she knows that Bobby sucks at desserts. Didn't you think to yourself at the time, \"Why hasn't anyone else thought to do that?\" I bet they have. I bet lots of people have. But to ensure that Bobby maintains a favorable batting average (and therefore looks good/stays happy on the show), the producers ask what chefs intend to cook as their signature dish in the audition process, and then only pick challengers who either a), are going to cook something that's already in Bobby's wheelhouse (how many times have we seen that happen?), or b), are going to cook something unique, but it's an irregular (or just plain stupid) version of that unique thing. Given that when confronted with a dish unfamiliar to him, Bobby always prepares a straightforward version, Bobby's earnest dish will usually win out over the platter of WHUT put out by the challenger. Don\u2019t take my word for it, just watch the show. Usually when the challenger announces their dish you think to yourself, \u201coh Bobby\u2019s screwed on this one,\u201d but then immediately they cut to that interview where a smiling, imbecilic contender says, \u201cMy version of ________ has ... [some looney goddamn ingredient or technique that doesn\u2019t belong in that dish].\u201d And then they are oh-so-surprised at the end of the show when their inane concoction gets clobbered by Mr. Flay. BTW if you\u2019re still doubtful, the producers HAVE to know the secret in advance. There\u2019s no way they\u2019re stopping production while a P.A. runs out to buy liver & onions. Which brings me back to Anne Burrell and her cheesecake. Celebrity chefs win against Bobby more often because they are who they are, and they can cook whatever they want to. The producers are just happy to have them on the show, and when Bobby loses to them it doesn't look as bad. This also illuminates why we so often see judges who themselves have a background in whatever the signature dish is. If the producers know what the challenger is going to cook, they can bring in judges who know how it's supposed to be cooked (and also importantly, know that it's not supposed to be cooked in whatever godforsaken manner than the challenger plans). One final thing: Though I\u2019m inclined to believe that Bobby doesn\u2019t actually know what the signature dish will be (even though the producers do), I wouldn\u2019t be too terribly surprised if one of his assistants or sous-chefs has been told the dish and has \u201cseeded\u201d Bobby\u2019s pantry with ideas. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s always well-stocked, but c\u2019mon ... it can\u2019t hold more than a fraction of what\u2019s in the supermarket. So when Bobby looks and sees a bottle of, say, pomegranate molasses that\u2019s not normally there, that\u2019s his clue. \u201cOh yeah, a gastrique would work really well here.\u201d This might seem a bit shady, but it doesn\u2019t conflict directly with anything the show tells you about how it works. And that, my friends, is \u201creality\u201d TV. The producers most definitely know. How else do they always find judges that are experts in that type of cuisine to judge the competition? While I do think Bobby Flay is actually that good (regardless of how cocky he can appear), I do agree with you that the competitor tends to be their own worst enemy. I feel like they always go overboard with their dish to try and wow the judges that they forget they simply just need to beat Bobby\u2019s dish. Bobby takes the dish and just makes sure all the flavors and textures are there while the competitor tries to make the dish more unique and their own. It rarely works. I've always thought of Bobby Flay as an arrogant douche, but the tiramisu episode of BBF confirmed that he is a douche. In the middle of the tiramisu challenge, he decided to make 4 cheeseburgers from scratch just for fun to eat during. Fuck that. That was so disrespectful to the challenger pastry chef. so happy Amanda won though! love when I see people/places from Austin on FN :) From binge watching this show the past week, it\u2019s clear that Bobby has advance knowledge of what he might face. Recall that Iron Chef also wasn\u2019t a total surprise as to the featured ingredient. PS - Good analysis from OP. Bobby has never made anything that the competition challenges him too. He just makes a completely different dish and calls it a Southwest version of whatever he was supposed to make. bobby flay is an iron chef for a reason. he is going up against mostly home cooks or restaurant chefs. while i do agree that they do selective casting, which all shows do anyways for entertainment purposes, i do believe that he is that good. The producers know, but I don't think they're actively try and push the scales against Bobby. They want the competetors to cook their own signature dish because that's interesting - it's the premise of the show.

I just saw a post making mention of a similar situation which reminded me of this, and thought you guys might get a giggle/facepalm out of it. I do device repairs & technical support for quite a few families and businesses locally, and a couple of years back received an emergency call. The owner of one of the businesses I support had purchased a new phone and needed to know how to transfer important data to it from her old phone. I order a taxi, grab my laptop and head out. It turned out the \"important data\" was her Candy Crush progress, but she didn't let me know this until I arrived. I tried to make light of it - I wasn't particularly amused at having my evening interrupted for this - and deadly serious, she snapped back that it was important because she was trying to give up smoking and she needed it to relax during work breaks. I looked up how to do it (via Facebook account, it turns out; she had never logged in on the old phone), transferred the data over and charged her double time for the post-5pm call out. If they're paying emergency rates, I'd take a trivial job as a freebie compared to the usual stakes. Those tend to come with \"We're losing $X,000 per hour while this is ongoing, fix it\" levels of pressure. Yeah, the rates stopped me from being pissed off with her. Also grabbed a takeaway (takeout for our American readers) on the way home, which was a bonus. Gave me a kind of existential \"Do I really mean that little to my customers?\" thing when I got back, though. You mean exactly as much as you charge. Our firm raised our rates recently by 30% and lost 3-7% of our clients because we were \"too expensive\". We're now charging hourly for the miscellaneous things clients brought to us vs per project completed and the tiny little shitty projects we're doiong now has decreased. Yep, it's far wiser to be slightly over market rates when contracting. You don't want the people barely willing to pay market rates as customers, they are often unreasonably demanding and see normal rates as crazy high. The people who won't mind paying a little more can usually afford it fine, don't fret over it, and tend to treat you better.

I said \"Nice standing desk, when did you get that?\". \"Thanks, just today.\" He replied. That was literally all that was said about the desk. We talked about work related stuff and as I walked out and checked my phone, there was an ad on Facebook for that EXACT model of standing desk. I have never owned one, wanted one, or googled one before. Yet there it was on my feed. Tin foil hat be damned, they listen in. I've had this happen to me twice in the last month. Things I talked about with my daughter, one being hard boiled eggs, showed up on my feed hours later. There it was, an ad for a hard boiled egg cooker ... never googled anything about hard boiled eggs. Weird af. I can't remember the first one. When I said something to my daughter about it after the first time, she called me crazy. When I showed her the egg thing .... she said, well damn .... you might be right! This has happened to me multiple times! The time that really seals the deal for me is when my mother asked me to be a surrogate for her (which was heavily declined, as she doesn't need any more children to ruin) one day while over my house. It was either later on or the next day that I was telling my boyfriend about how ridiculous it was for her to be asking me to be a surrogate. Low and behold, scrolling through Facebook I get an ad that says \"become a surrogate\". Never in my life have I had an ad for surrogates until I said the words aloud. Creepy. Or, Facebook figured out that you work in an office which recently purchased a standing desk, through purely digital means. Most likely: your phone has connected to the wifi at your office at some point. Or, if you ever look at Facebook on your work computer, that would be enough as well. Presumably your coworker or your office's admin person ordered that standing desk online. They searched for it, ordered it, got an email confirmation, probably paid with a company credit card, got a delivery confirmation email, maybe he even googled assembly tips while setting it up. If you've ever accessed your Facebook through the IP address associated with your workplace (like by using their wifi), you've been connected to the purchase of that standing desk already. Even if you've never connected your phone to your work wifi or logged into your Facebook on your work computer, it's not that hard to associate you and your devices with your company, and then with purchases made in its office. If you've listed your job or checked into your workplace on Facebook ... even if you're friends with coworkers and one of them has done that ... if your LinkedIn has your cell number connected to sync contacts or reset a password ... There are a lot of ways to connect you to that standing desk besides a mic. That Natacha Jiatt was murdered by the Catholic Church for exposing a pedophile ring This is trending on r/conspiracy and r/outoftheloop right now, credit to u/uft8 for the summary Natacha Jaitt, a model/TV journalist, exposed a pedophile ring on live Argentinian TV a few months ago, after following cases over the last few years. She had claimed that she would not commit suicide in April of 2018 while investigating these rings, but was found on February 23, 2019 to be dead from suicide Another journalist she had accused of pedophilia on the airing, Luis Ventura, had uploaded an image of her dead body shortly after she killed herself on Twitter, and then promptly deleted it afterwards. To quote u/happycakeday1 She supposedly died from a cocaine overdose (heart failure/stroke). She had said that if she wound up dead, the people she had accused of rape (she was on trial, and it was powerful people) would be guilty (\"I won't kill myself, I won't overdose and drown in a bathtub, I won't shoot myself\") If she actually said all of that on the record then yeah, she was most likely murdered.

Thus, our current gender system should only be tweaked, not radically changed. Societal norms are set by the majority. Since most people are cisgender (and heterosexual), norms reflect that. This isn\u2019t inherently an issue. It\u2019s only when we don\u2019t tolerate deviation from norms that it becomes a problem. It\u2019s neither necessary, possible, nor desirable to erase all gender norms, since they are willingly followed by most. The vast majority of people, cis or trans, identify as male or female, and have an appearance that matches. This makes our binary gender assumption norms useful. Most people want their gender assumed off appearance or else don\u2019t care; it\u2019s only a very few whose appearance doesn\u2019t match gender, or identify as a non-binary gender. Society already accommodates situations like this. We provide wheelchair ramps, nut-free foods, and gender neutral bathrooms on top of the stairs, PB&J, and gendered bathrooms that most people use. You might have to ask someone or travel a bit more to be accommodated, but society has deemed this small extra effort acceptable, because very few people need to be accommodated. It\u2019s thus reasonable to expect the individual to request certain pronouns if it\u2019s important to them. Society recognizes disabilities, allergies, and even hard to pronounce names as legitimate. The root issue is that non-conforming genders aren\u2019t always recognized as legitimate, and harassment of the group occurs. No one says to a person who says they have an allergy \u201cReally? You don\u2019t look like you have an allergy?\u201d We all need to be educated and tolerant towards other pronouns and genders, and not tolerate harassment of this group. Basically, recognize your assumptions aren\u2019t always correct, and be gracious if you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a waste of time and effort to make everyone ask or introduce pronouns or gender, because most people don\u2019t care. You should feel free to do this if you want to, but otherwise, you have to live with reasonable assumptions. This solution is much more practical, and much more likely to be implemented and accepted by everyone. In essence, make an assumption, if you find out otherwise, go with it. This isn\u2019t difficult or a big deal. As far as ethics and economics are concerned, this solution is the best one. CMV, I\u2019d be glad to discuss parts of the solution you take issue with in more detail I generally agree with this, but it is context sensitive. If you are at a venue where you are asked to introduce yourself and your pronouns, it is churlish to refuse to do so, AND in that context it\u2019s best to ask rather that assume. Since that kind of venue is fairly rare, it is not an unusual burden to \u2018go with the flow\u2019. I organize events professionally, and have never included as part of introductions. The number of people who are uncomfortable with the practice exceeds the number of people who prefer asking. In issues of human decency \u2018majority rules\u2019 is not the rule of thumb. But I do think asking for pronouns / not assuming gender will remain a fairly fringe activity that you find in a few colleges, churches, support groups and therapy contexts and not much outside of that. I would agree wholeheartedly that in certain contexts, this makes sense. I think the key is that you\u2019d be informed about it, like if you\u2019re going to an LBGT or transgender event, obviously you might want to be more careful. If everyone is expected to introduce their pronouns in the venue, then you may as well follow suit. As I\u2019ve said, though, I don\u2019t think it would be best to apply this idea society-wide though. Exactly. There\u2019s a time and a place for everything and a majority of people use pronouns based on their assigned gender. Gender dysphoria is not a common thing but knowing when you will encounter a higher concentration of people who are transgender should be key in determining your behavior. Classic \u201cknow your audience\u201d type of thing. I can\u2019t even remember names of people I meet. I guess I\u2019d have to take a notebook to such an event to remember names and pronouns. Oh and a Polaroid camera to remember who they belong to lol. I think if you\u2019re at a place where people provide preferred pronouns at introduction you\u2019re skipping the part that necessitates assumption. I've been more or less reprimanded in a Starbucks for a \"he got my order\", and I easily have a hundred encounters a week where I reasonably have ZERO time to do that dance.

You don't go to the gym and expect not to be tired afterwards, but that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy working out Agreed - am a serious introvert, but my life would be way less fullfilling and way less rich with great life experiences in the realm of friends, partying, girls, etc if I hadn't made a conscious effort get good at behaving in a more extroverted manner enough of the time to have the experiences I want to be a part of my life. Obviously different people have different priorities, and it isn't something that will work or be possible for everyone.

The difference is wether you become drained or energized when doing it To be fair, as far as my own experience goes, that assumption is not entirely without merits. People skills are skills, learned and maintained through use - be introverted enough that you don't do either of these and at some point your social skills are probably going to suffer.

Other colleagues often disturb visit me to ask if it's not sad for me to sit alone. No, God, it's fantastic. My battery depends on how I feel overall but that usually means I can do 10mins in the kitchen with my roommates before I'm tapped, or I can spend a night with 5 people in a smallish room while crushing them in gaming for a few hours.

The other night I was able to spend 2 hrs just chilling and talking with the roommates and some guests they had over, I knew my battery was close to being dead but I forced myself past my limit because one of the guests is attractive and I wanted a chance to flirt.

You can borrow from your own people. The money that is printed is FEDERAL RESERVE (thanks for the corrections) notes -- it's technically a debt that the Reserve owes the bearer of the note (but printing money does not technically increase the debt supply -- the role of money has changed since fiat currency). When you print more money, you are devaluing the rest of the currency that is already in circulation. This means that if the govt decided to print $ 100,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion dollars) in the span of a week, the value of the dollar would probably crash pretty hard (probably ...). This is related because people use money to buy US debt -- we're loaning the US govt the very money it prints. The only reason that this results in anything favorable is because people all over the world value USD and that paper currency represents potential labor, new assets, etc. If you own a baseball card of Sammy Sosa, there is a chance it could be worth a lot of money. Now imagine if the card company just mails a Sammy Sosa card to every family in America. Your Sammy Sosa card isn't worth anything anymore because there are so many of them and everyone has it now. Now imagine if they mailed another 5 to everyone -- the value crashes even harder because there are SO many of them now. That's the same idea with money. You can't keep printing more money or else the value of it will deteriorate. But the gov't keeps issuing more debt and we still look at $ 20 like it's $ 20, right? Eventually, there could come a time when we look at a $ 20 bill and it means nothing to us. This is what happened in Zimbabwe where a billion dollar transaction might happen for a loaf of bread. They printed so much money (without proper secure backing by the gov't) that it just became worthless. So they started to just increase the numbers on their currency so you can actually pay for something. Because the gov't theoretically owes its population money, they issue paper as a certificate of this. You might not have physically went to the bank and traded something in return for paper but you did something that warranted the earning of that dollar. If you work for a company, they pay you that money because it has value and you can buy things with it. The only reason it has value is because the US gov't says it does. You can pay gov't-related fees and bills with the money they issue and because the gov't is well-secured, people accept it. If our gov't was unstable, no one would trust the dollars they slept under for warmth because the gov't could just come out and say, 'Sorry we're not paying you guys back'. Well what would they be paying back? To whom are they paying back to? It used to be gold. But as we grew as a planet, we ran out of gold to back every dollar with and it just became a nightmare to handle. Enter, fiat currency, a piece of paper that means nothing except what the gov't says it means. People used to go to banks with gold and receive 'money' for it. The banks would literally hold their gold and give them an certificate that says they own a claim of gold in their vaults. If ANYONE brought that certificate to the bank, they could expect to receive gold for it. That's what gave it value. You could say you want that farmer's potatoes and he can go get $ 1 of gold from the bankers at his convenience or he could hold onto it and use it just like the person did before him -- 'trade' it for something else like new shoes. Why? Because everyone liked gold and everyone believed gold had value. Eventually, this took off and people stopped trading for things and we developed currency with quantitative values that allowed for easy exchanges to take place. So you might think,' Well, now that there isn't gold behind my dollar, how is it worth anything even if the gov't say it is? They won't give me anything in return for it\". The same thing applies to gold. No one wants gold unless other people want gold. If you can't reasonably trade your gold for something else, then what value does it have? (Someone did point out you can shave gold flakes into your water and drink it, like some companies have chosen to do, but that's on you) As long as people continue to value dollars, it doesn't matter what it's worth, sans some certain supply and demand laws. So gold is no different in that regard. The ONE difference between paper currency and gold is that $ 100,000 in cash weighs a lot less than $ 100,000 in gold and is a lot easier to hide too.

This kinda seems all over the place but it should be good starter information for someone trying to understand debt markets and macroeconomics, in general. Monetary supply and debt are pretty hand-in-hand, even if they're not exactly the same thing. Larger and more complex economies warranted the development of fiat currency which ultimately changed the role of currency, in general.

I think I read that if food was low, rabbits will abort their young and reabsorb them. We're the only animal that does it consciously. That we know of. But to be fair, we're the only animal that does anything consciously which involves deep planning. That we know of. Plot twist: cats are the smartest species on earth and will overthrow humans when we realize that we\u2019re their servants. ... and for good reason. What about the Ai currently proliferating through our computer networks? Don't they count??? WHERE IS YOUR HEART?!?! We\u2019re too fucking good at it. How would we know? Perhaps other species went extinct because they stopped reproducing. But did they do so planningly? And eating But we still like to practice. I think it's coyotes that will howl at certain times and listen for responses to decide if an area is over populated. Not sure if that means they go somewhere else to hump or just stay where they are and don't hump. In our defense human babies are the worst of all the species. How would we know that they didn\u2019t? It\u2019s not to prove that they did, just stating that the option is there. It\u2019s not provable or unprovable. Yeah other animals just eat their babies This has to do with the fact that raising our offspring is labor and resource intensive. Many species can walk minutes after birth. Due to the size of our heads and the limited size of the birth canal, humans are born relatively premature. Those children then have to be taken care of for years before they can even begin to fend for themselves. This is even more pronounced in prosperous societies where only one or two children are even needed and we can legitimately afford not to make children work.", "human1": "Some Reddit forum users discuss whether humans are the only species which practices birth control to prevent reproduction, leading to a discussion of whether or not pandas are poor at reproducing, and some other animals which may become less reproductive when food is scarce, such as rats and rabbits."}, "GUM_reddit_polygraph": {"fulltext": "The Hiring Process Vol. 3 / Polygraph and Deception Detection Devices Polygraph and other deception detection devices. First, this is not me telling you how to beat polygraph (poly.) When taking the test, it is common for the examiner to ask if you have researched how to pass the poly deceptively. So, if you read this, understand that I am not going to tell you how to beat the test. It is also worth mentioning that doing something like that is, generally, a bad idea. Second, let\u2019s just get something out of the way. A polygraph is not admissible in criminal court, and for good reason. It is not going to give us specific information. There have been people who have lied and not shown deception. There are some people who showed deception, who were not necessarily lying. Having said that, it is still a great tool for verifying truthfulness, and I\u2019m a big fan of using it in this kind of a process. Hopefully I can explain to you why that happens here. All of these Deception Detection Devices (DDD) work on a basic principal. Your body has involuntary and automatic responses to lying. Basically, you are afraid of getting caught. No matter how little, there is still a bit of everyone that hopes we don\u2019t get caught. The fact that you\u2019re hooked up to the machine really tends to amplify this. These machines are actually fear detectors. They measure your body\u2019s reaction to fear, like your heart rate increasing or changing just to name one. So how does a truthful person show deception? Let me show you. 20 years ago, an applicant \u2026 let\u2019s call him Joe \u2026 was out with friends at a bar. While there he was approached by a prostitute who offered him her services. Joe, being the fine and upstanding individual he is, turned her down. On his background paperwork he indicated that he had never paid anyone for sex and he has never sought to pay anyone for sex \u2026 both are true. However, Joe has a flash of a thought from that night when the examiner asks him if he has paid for sex. His body, automatically, is afraid that he should have said something. The machine will pick that reaction up. The reason this isn't scientific is because just because it shows deception on a particular subject, doesn't mean you\u2019re lying \u2026 it means that there is usually more to that story. To combat this, before you take the poly you will talk with the examiner and go over every question that is on the exam. That way you can address any gray areas. You may have answered a question in your background with a \u201cno\u201d answer, but there is a \u201ccomma, but\u201d to it though \u2026 if you know what I mean. Make sure that you address any of these areas with the background investigator and with the polygraph examiner before taking the test. That way, you\u2019ll feel that it\u2019s been addressed and it is much more likely to be a non-issue. Third, please know that common sense is still very much on the table. Have you seen the scene from Ocean\u2019s Eleven where the \u201csmart guy\u201d is undergoing a polygraph so he can get the casino job? They put a thumb tack in his shoe so that when he could poke his foot on the truthful answers and not on the lies. That way he was consistent through the exam. He was always stressed. The examiner even makes the comment that \u201cman to look at him, I would swear he\u2019s being deceptive.\u201d Well, first \u2026 the thumb tack trick doesn't work \u2026 don\u2019t try it. You\u2019ll end up with a hurt foot, and deception everywhere. Second, the human element will be sure to include any potential signs of deception. Again, it is generally a bad idea to try and determine how to beat this test. Don\u2019t do it, just be honest through the process. Each step is there for a reason. Finally, and most importantly, you should know that everyone is intimidated by this step in the process. You don\u2019t need to worry about nervousness tripping the machine or giving you a false indication of deception. If it did that just because people were nervous, then no one would ever pass these tests. The poly tends to be the part of the process that everyone dreads \u2026 and that really shouldn't be the case. You have already answered every question during your background investigation that they are going to ask you on the polygraph. Be honest and thorough during that portion of the process and you\u2019ll be fine. I hope this has illuminated the polygraph a bit. It\u2019s one of the more intimidating portions of the process, I understand this. It should be the easiest part though. You've already answered these questions, some of them several times. This should just be about verifying what we already know. Thank you for taking the time to read this, should you have any questions feel free to PM me. I\u2019m also taking requests for the next edition in this series. I was leaning towards interviews, but that may require some separation as there are several formats you\u2019ll see in this kind of a process.

Hey, guys! As an American, we obviously learn about US history to a much greater extent than I imagine any of you guys would in school. Along with knowing our history, we also have grown up in the culture that\u2019s resulted from nearly 250 years of our country\u2019s existence and from far more many years before our revolution. Naturally, we see the racial issues and tensions occurring today as a very logical conclusion, personal to each individual, and as intense in the realm of politics. So, my questions are: (1) How do different European countries feel/interpret our seemingly, from an outsider\u2019s point of view, obsession with race? Do many people not understand why? (2) Do many people from your country not know anything about our very important domestic historical events/movements (e.g. our kind of slavery, the Civil War, the Reconstruction Era, the Golden Age of Racism in the 1920s + the KKK, Jim Crow + redlining, the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, and Black Lives Matter + criminal justice reform today, etc.)? (3) What are your guys\u2019 general thoughts when you hear about our outrage over a racial issue today? US society does seem quite obsessed with race, and while the very concept of dividing people into races is repulsive to me, I understand why this is a big deal in the US - and I understand why European views on the issue are usually too simplistic. I'm pretty sure that most people here only have a very vague idea of US history in this regard. Slavery is widely known, so is the KKK (albeit superficially), but I'm quite sure most people have no idea what Jim Crow laws are, or that official segregation continued into the 1960s, and most other race-related history. It definitely looks to me like American society as a whole isn't doing a good job of moving past these issues, and that the racial division is even encouraged at some level, but I am not as presumption as to preach solutions, having never lived in the US, let alone as a racial minority. I find it annoying when Americans try to apply US racial concepts to Europe, and thus make absurd statements, so it's only fair for me to admit my limited understanding of the subject, even if I consider myself to know US history better than 90% of Europeans. \"sn't doing a good job of moving past these issues\" Is that entirely true, though? The Civil Rights movement ended 50 years ago, and there's been a black president since then. There's still tons of problems, but it's massively improved. To be a minority in the USA today is a night and day difference to what it was during my grandparents' time. It's not even close to what segregation was. (1) Its unreal. I can\u2019t really imagine being asked which race I am to fill out a college application form or something like that. Affirmative action here is very rare, and very often illegal. (2) More or less we know what happened. (3) Its understandable, since no one ever admitted that a lot of American freedom and prosperity comes from crimes against humanity Your last point is a little complicated. The US's wealth and power also comes from no actions of it's own, but it's geographical location in the world. We are a considerably lucky country, with only two neighbors that are completely non hostile, and two massive oceans on either side of us. We were always going to have advantages as a newly independent country the moment colonialist rule lost it's control here. It's not as simple as \"All of USA's achievements come from exploitation\"", "human1": "An American asks some Europeans how they view US preoccupation with race issues and its history, with answers suggesting that Europeans know the history more or less, and that, while understandable, many US race concepts do not apply in Europe."}, "GUM_reddit_ring": {"fulltext": "Is this ring? http://vocaroo.com/i/s1tDCvWpykHC Is that ring I'm hearing? I feel I sang quite well here, but then it's often hard to find back to this voice. Are you an opera singer? Why are you concerned about \"ring\"? I've been instructed to try developing it. I am trying to develop a generally pleasant voice, I have no clear idea about style. Ring is one of those things, IMO, that some dweeb voice teacher heard sitting in an audience from a real opera singer. He heard a \"ring\" and decided to make it into a technique. First of all the term is poorly defined. Does it mean twang? Singer formant? Which harmonic? Chiaroscuro? Second of all you're not an opera singer! Ring is characteristic of operatic voices. Have you ever heard a contemporary pop or rock singer with a \"ring\" in their voice? No! I would just stop worrying about trying to do shit which is not relevant to the style you're trying to learn. Focus on singing whatever it is you want to sing ... not on singing opera! Alright. Do you notice anything I should work on in particular? Is it possible from just a recording? How much do you practice? =p. How many days a week and hour many hours? Whenever I have the apartment to myself. Usually twenty - thirty minutes. Couple times a week I get several sessions that are longer. Do more practicing. Gotta get over not wanting to practice when people are around =p. That's really the only proven way to get results. Practice. If you want a ring ... I believe you have to use a strong chest dominant sound. Try an EE vowel in the comfortable area of your voice. Like right here. You have to do these alternate vowels right here in this ipa chart. so instead of 'i' it'd be 'Y' (ee as in sweet a -> \u0252. If you try to sound like an opera singer, it'll just come to you I guess (if you have the ear). Won't really happen if you try to sound like a pop singer unless you're like Josh Groban, which many say he's a popera singer. lol Is there a particular specific example or explaination your can give on the type of' ring' you are referring to? Are you referring to the slight ping in certain people's voices that give it a clarity or you talking about the slight' oomph' in certain people's voices? Either way, yeah i think it is a pretty decent sounding voice. You mentioned that your teacher is asking you to open the throat and i would like to know what he/she said to instruct you to open the throat. What i am noticing is that the vowel is tending towards the 'pushed' and spread side possibly from a slight over emphasis on the opening of the throat. Here is the key, you need to both have an open / relaxed throat with a clear sound. A clear sound being a sound with clarity and focus or some would term to as 'ping'. One way you can do it is pretty simple. Simply do 2 sets of scales on the same key. The do-mi-re-fa-mi-so-fa-re-mi-do-re-ti-do(the one you do on the recording). Do it twice. First on a hum/ng sound and then on the second scale open the vowel in either an 'EE' or an 'Ah'. Do either the hum or the 'ng'. Whichever is more comfortable for you. The 'ng' is basically a sustained 'ng' pronunciation as in the word 'sing' or 'ring'. Some also would call this an open hum. Then on the hum/ng, try to find a clear buzzing sensation in the front of your face and at the lips if you are doing a hum. Do not force the sensation, focus on simply humming and the sensation should materialize by itself. Then simply try to keep this same clarity or 'buzz' when you open the mouth into the EE/AH vowel. You may need to record yourself while doing this. Many a times i have notice that people can produce a relatively focused and clean hum/ng. But when they open the mouth to produce a vowel, the tone quality drastically changes into something way less focused and clear. So when you record yourself, see if you can produce the cleanest most 'forward' sound on the hum/ng and see that if you open to the vowel, does the tone quality drastically change. The goal is to keep the tone quality relatively consistent. Remember that you are trying to keep the same clarity and focus, different people sound different when the open the hum depending on the physiology of the vocal tract and cords. So it is more important to focus on the forward clarity so as to not make the sound overly nasal or squeezed. Hope this helped!", "human1": "One person asks for feedback about their singing voice as they attempt to produce 'ring', and others give advice on practicing and improving the sound of the voice, including by exercising specific sounds and recording oneself."}, "GUM_reddit_social": {"fulltext": "Social Requirements? TL;DR: I'm 36, married, and introvert. I'm going into my second year of a PhD program, and I've found myself being subjected to numerous social things that I feel obligated to contend with, primarily due to social pressure - club meetings, happy hours, BBQs, etc. Long story short, I'm older, and would rather spend my time at home with a video game than basically any of the people in my department, save very few (who I have no problem hanging out with outside of the academic setting). Does anyone else deal with this? Does the guilt get to you? I'm 23, single, and an introvert. I try to show up every once in a while to remind people that I exist but I don't go to most parties and happy hours. You have the great excuse of a family to go home to. Use it! I think it's important to attend some of these engagements. You never know who you might meet or what you may miss. I too am an older grad student and am engaged. Socially, I have no reason to attend these events. I remind my fianc\u00e9 that it is imperative to attend at least a few a year for those purpose of networking and reminding people I exist. Remember, at present your cohort are your fellow students ...in the future they could be your coworkers or colleagues in a professional setting. Totally agree (though I'm very social and also organize a lot of these kinds of events). People who don't attend departmental events at all or put in face time can miss out on a lot of opportunities. I'm in a position where I am often asked to recommend fellow students for awards, grant opportunities, jobs, and publishing opportunities. If I only see you once a year and I don't know or trust you, I won't be recommending you for anything. I imagine it's the same for faculty. If people don't see you often enough to build a relationship, they aren't going to go out of their way to help you succeed. I agree with this. And making appearances at things like department BBQs and club meetings will probably earn you points with your adviser/other faculty. You don't have to be friends with everyone but you should probably make an effort to get to know people and make connections. edit: Just to build on this. Don't feel guilty about not going to something. If it's not important to you, it's not important to you. Just don't feel obligated to every single meeting, BBQ, and happy hour. I think it\u2019s important to go to SOME events in the name of collegiality, but you are under no obligation to go to all of them or feel guilty for declining things like happy hours. Grad school can be a very isolating experience, so after work events are good for people without local support networks (a girl in my program told me last week that she didn\u2019t talk to a single person over that weekend) but are not required. I make sure to put in an appearance at the major events (back to school reception, holiday party, end of year reception) but don\u2019t let people guilt me into other things. \u201cThanks for inviting me, but I have other plans\u201d is all you need. Then don\u2019t go. There\u2019s no shame in not participating. No, but there are downsides, like not building a network. Unless you are in a department full of extroverts that shame you for this Plus networking is a thing. Getting in appearances with professors that might hold job opportunities is vital depending on your field. Though balance is key. You don't have to go to all of the socials. Some of them are for us lonely, single extroverts that need a social life. Focus on club meetings that will look good on your CV and happy hours that have important professionals attending. Yeah why do I fave the feeling mist profs can\u2019t help u get a job through their connections I say this as a pretty social member of a pretty social dept - don't burn bridges, but don't go if you don't want to! I think a lot of social events help new students find their friends, and help maintain a wide network of camaraderie and support. If you don't feel like you need those, then stay friendly with people but don't feel the need to attend. Maybe go to the particularly big events and a thing or two at the beginning of the semester to meet the new students (considering that your existing friends may graduate before you!) and call that good. Well at least you're married and have someone who gets you to hang out with. I'm 30, also going into my second yr and I've already passed on several invites. I just straight up tell them I'm going home if asked or ignore the invite completely. I feel like everybody got to know me last year and I'm a pleasant enough coworker to be around but there was no real connection there and tbh I think everyone is okay with it. I'm not particularly special so I doubt I'm missed that much lol, so I don't feel quilty. The big events I might go to like end of summer BBQ, but like coffee and lunch and happy hour (I hate beer) I MIA and everyone seems cool with it. Weird, I don't remember writing this post ... I'm the same way! You aren't under any obligation to attend social events, but don't completely write them off either. No one goes to every event but find a timeline that fits with your other obligations and see if you can make it to one a month or something like that. I went into my program thinking of the degree as the end goal, but there is a lot more to gain from graduate school than more letters after your name. Socializing can help you get more out of your program, have friends to talk about your research with who actually care and will be interested in talking out complex points you're stuck on. These are also people who can let you know about fellowships, conferences etc. that will enhance your experience.

Logically, in a incredibly vast universe, it makes sense that humans aren't the only sentient beings out there. The problem with this is that I don't know if that's what we're working with anymore, the entire conception of distant suns, planets, black -holes, alien life. It's all suspect because we get all our news and information from a small group of people and these people are liars. I watched 'The Martian' a few days ago, how much of it actually corresponds to the realities of space and space travel? When we see an astronaut in the iss, is there really someone in a craft up there or is it all created in a studio somewhere? One thing we do know is that they can simulate the appearance of weightlessness since at least 1995. Just watch the apollo 13 movie. Anyone who bothers to actually look into's the details of nasa's claims will realize they never went to the moon, let alone 6 times. During Apollo there's a video of astronauts supposedly in space taking a video of the earth, yet the video (that goes on recording after they think its over) reveals that they used cardboard to block the windows to create the illusion that they were far away and were probably only in low earth orbit. The actual structure of the iss itself looks different in different nasa pictures, how is this possible? There's abundant evidence that they faked the challenger disaster. Why? There are videos where women astronauts have weird puffy hair (which shouldn't happen) in the iss when their hair doesn't act in such a way on zero gravity planes. There are videos of astronauts supposedly in space when suddenly a bubble leaves their helmet. The amount of fakery is overwhelming, how does nasa even have a shred of credibility left? Does hubble even actually exist? tldr: We get all our information about space from space agencies and hollywood (they've always worked together) Space agencies lie all the time, about everything How can we claim to know anything if #2 is true? Conclusion We'll never get anywhere as a species as long as humanity continues to believe nasa are legitimate scientists I might even say \"we know all-shit about space\". o_o Talk about accepting stuff on faith? With weak evidence? May as well be a Space Religion, considering how much of the stuff any of us have actually experienced outside of movies/media ... which is ZERO. No, really, if anyone here has an actual story of experiencing Space, I'd love to hear it. Pretty sure we all get to say it's second-hand experience, at best. I don't have that kind of faith in things I can't experience for myself. Sounds frightful (froughtful). EDIT: Further, my oldest living friend (let's call him Whelp Allgood), who I can talk to about anything -- is a space lover. He dreams of piloting ships among the stars. I had the unfortunate moment of making him realize that he had never experienced anything of the sort outside of movies, games, 'news reports', and the like. I pointed out that so much of the rest of this world was purposely confuggulated to us from birth -- how can one possibly accept this on faith? I felt the crushing force I had unintentionally sprung on him. :/ But Truth. P. S. Intellectual dishonesty is so not cute. Good luck with your religion. :) The earth is definately flat.

On the drive over, my wife reiterated many times to me just how important it was to make a good impression. I scoffed and arrogantly informed my silly wife that I always make good impressions. My wife's boss is a single lady in her fifties, so it was just the three of us. We chitchatted over drinks and salads and seemed to really be hitting it off. She laughed at my well-timed, perfectly-appropriate jokes and my wife seemed pleased. Soon she brought out the main course, a nice big juicy steak for each of us. As I began to cut into my steak, I was discouraged to discover how under cooked this steak was. Now, I've had my fair share of rare steak. I prefer medium, but I can handle rare. This was several-minutes-on-a-hot-grill short of rare. I probably could've resuscitated the cow had I tried. Instead, I sat there fidgeting with my knife and fork, worrying about how I was going to get away with not eating this steak. Claim vegan-ism? No, I'd already feigned great enthusiasm upon seeing the steak. Just then, our hostess excused herself to the kitchen to take care of some dessert preparations. As I looked across the fancy dining room table at the open window of this 3rd story apartment ... a cartoon light bulb appeared over my head. I knew I had to be decisive, realizing that she could return at any moment. I committed. I grabbed the steak with my hand, gently shook off the juice and executed a perfect throw right through the center of the open window. Here's the big time FU. The window wasn't open. It was the cleanest fricking window you've ever seen in your life. That is, until my mostly raw slab of steak slammed up against it and slowly slid down leaving a trail of bloody juice in its wake. My wife - who's steak was a nice medium rare and was unaware of my predicament - turned, jaw dropped, and stared at me like I was an alien from another planet. This look then slowly morphed into more of a there-is-no-place-on-this-planet-you-can-ever-hide-from-me expression of demonic anger. My wife's boss heard the thud of the steak-on-window impact and came quickly. She took in the scene, the steak sitting on the window sill, the blood trail, my empty plate, and then gave me an inquisitive, puzzled look. I just didn't know what to say. It felt like a minute of silence, but was probably 3 or 4 seconds. Finally, the best I could manage was \"I ... I'm so sorry. I am such a clutz ... I don't know ... I was just cutting it .. and ... it ... ... it slipped ... just ask my wife, I really am a clutz ... right honey? ... (no help coming from that direction) ... I will clean this up ... I can't believe this ... I am so sorry\" etc ... etc ... Both women continued to stare at me like I had escaped from the loony bin, as I smeared the blood around the window with my cloth napkin, dusted off the steak, and continued to mutter my incoherent explanation. I knew no one was buying the story. I knew what I had to do. I sheepishly returned to my seat and proceeded to eat every bite of that disgusting, cold, chewy, bloody, raw steak.

I internally 'knew' what was going on (after the initial hours of just being a complete mess), but the internal monologue was very simplistic -- it was an understanding and acknowledgment of my surroundings and what was going on, but also a realization that my consciousness was traumatically altered. It was a mess of thoughts, but the acute period was mostly just sleeping and just acknowledging major changes (\"Oh, I guess I can't walk anymore,\" and \"Oh, I guess I'll have to learn how to write left-handed now\") but there wasn't much going on. Best, /MurrayStreet I could always speak to some degree, sometimes it was jibberish but I could speak ... so not sure how useful my experience is for you.

I felt like I was present, but in hindsight I wasn't nearly as with it as I felt internally at the time. I thought I was participating in conversation with my family, but my husband tells me I just kind of laid there and laughed or nodded my head ... did not contribute and when I tried it didn't make sense. I felt like I was speaking normally and couldn't understand why people would look at me funny or not understand, at least until I was prompted to say certain words and was unable to say them at all ... then I somewhat accepted it. I remember bits and pieces of the conversation, my brother talking to the nurse about some tool they used to keep an eye on ICP, etc. I knew where I was, but I didn't feel like I should be there. I always knew my husband was there and only left when other family stayed with me. I really appreciated that. I just got back from visiting and it seems like my cousin's experience has a lot in common with yours. In less than a week, she can walk on her own, and apparently can play Wii. She seems to recognize most people, although she couldn't identify herself in a picture. :-( Her vocabulary is limited but we are able to communicate. A lot of my family have young children so they brought in children's books and are reading them to her. Is that a good start, or should we just grab a Jane Austen and read that to her? We'll definitely be taking our cues from the speech therapists for re-teaching her language but to entertain and stimulate should we raise the reading level? The speech therapists and her doctor(s) would probably have the best ideas based on her progress but if it seems like she follows the children's books I would just bump it up gradually by trying middle readers and young adult. I was able to understand people the entire time, but there is no way I could really keep up with a novel on the level of Jane Austen. I watched movies more than I read/was read to, and pretty simple movies at that so it didn't really matter if I followed every little thing. It sounds like she is making a lot of progress, honestly just being there to encourage and support her is the best thing and it sounds like she is getting a lot of that. I'll be wishing her the best. I didn't have any aphasia but I was overwhelmed and exhausted, in no position to judge just how bad the situation actually was. The two things that helped the most were being told that I could get my life back with a lot of hard work in rehab. I suspect my attention span was noticeably shorter at that point and I had not yet realized that I wasn't seeing everything on the left side. After being transferred to the rehab hospital, yet another strange medical place and bed with disturbing noises and fall alarms I remember wanting to cry when the sweet PT held my shoulder without indicating I was damaged goods and assured me she was on my side and there to help me get what I wanted.

The film Snyder showed the studio execs in mid 2015 was without a doubt the original cut. The 3 hr UE. I guess management needed to be a part of the production from its scripting stages. Snyder made the film he wanted to make. He did his job, but he had no oversight, but even he was aware that a 3 hr cut isnt necessarily what the studio wants. The studio should ve just released the UE. It probably would've made less with the decrease in number of showings, but it would've been a more respected film, and that carries more wait in the end. But the movie was uneven in its delivery of action sequences. It was mostly contained to the last act. Having a 2 hour set up of character building and dialogue isn't the best strategy when marketing to GA. They want to be entertained. WB probably saw this and wanted to get to the action much quicker, even though they wouldnt' have had to do that had there been multiple action sequences throughout the entire film. But all we got in the first 2 hrs was the short scene of Superman in Africa, Knightmare Batman, Batmobile scene, and then the non-stop 3rd hour. This film needed clear work from the very beginning.

This universal forum has enabled the peoples of the world to coordinate and harmonize their efforts in preserving peace and security, in achieving prosperity and upholding the values of human civilization. I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on being elected to preside over this august body and to express my confidence in your successful leadership. I would also like, on behalf of Albania, to convey to the Secretary-General our highest appreciation for his leading contribution to the fulfilment of the historical mission of the United Nations and to the aspirations of our peoples for a better world in which only peace, democracy and economic prosperity reign. This session of the General Assembly takes place in a milestone year for Europe. Only a few months ago, a historic event vitalized the dream of a more united and stronger Europe. Ten European countries, sharing a common aspiration for integration, were admitted into the European Union. The Albanian Government and society are engaged in an all-round European integration process, and they are carrying out necessary reforms with the necessary political will and drive. Albania is working to strengthen the democratic institutions and capacities of its central and local government with a view to bringing its legislation and conditions into line with European Union standards, progressively achieving concrete and measurable results, as previously defined. Determined to make our contribution to regional and global security, the Albanian Government considers the country's integration into NATO to be one of its major objectives. The NATO Istanbul Summit last June commended the progress made by my country in this regard and encouraged the deepening of reforms. It welcomed Albania's contribution to regional stability and cooperation and committed to assess our further progress at the next NATO summit, which would hopefully mark the start of negotiations for our full membership in the alliance. We believe that the commitments set up in the framework of the Adriatic Charter are also contributing to meet NATO standards, to the benefit of regional stability and security. We remain truly convinced that the respect and protection of human rights and freedoms are the main pillars of a pluralist democratic society. The Government of the Republic of Albania will continue to constantly demonstrate its commitment to a full implementation of the standards enshrined in the United Nations and Council of Europe conventions, as well as the relevant documents of regional organizations, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in which we are playing a very active role. We will continue to do so in the future as well. By adopting contemporary legislation and by becoming a party to other recently adopted international instruments on human rights, Albania has associated itself with countries that are enforcing a number of national strategies and programmes focusing on specific population groups, especially women, children, persons in need and minorities, among others. In recent years, the Albanian Government has started to periodically submit reports to the committees of the six main United Nations human rights treaties and is taking their recommendations into serious consideration. It is our belief that these international mechanisms play a significant and important role as guardians of the common human values we have together adopted. Albania, as one of the 191 signatory countries of the Millennium Declaration, remains fully committed to implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, which have been properly reflected in a national strategy for social and economic development. The pattern of our sustained economic growth, which is at 6 to 7 per cent for the seventh consecutive year, is a good support base for the whole society to maintain higher standards of respect for human rights and to fight poverty and crime. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the United Nations specialized agencies for their valuable assistance in support of the implementation of these objectives nationwide and on a central and local level. The Albanian Government is pleased to note that an ever-healthier climate of confidence and relations of bilateral and multilateral cooperation are prevailing in the South-Eastern European region. The countries of the region are fully engaged in a process that will lead us clearly toward Euro-Atlantic integration and at the same time continually remove us from the extremist tendencies that caused a number of conflicts in the last decade. The regional policy of my Government is guided by the motto: 'the more integrated in the region, the more integrated in Europe.' In implementing this policy, Albania is cooperating as never before with all the countries of the region by making borders less relevant, opening up to one regional market the implementation of free trade agreements and free movement corridors, and stimulating foreign direct investment. We are especially cooperating with the common fight against organized crime and all kinds of illegal trafficking. In the meantime, Albania is reinforcing its border management and control, guided by the European Union and NATO standards. My country will hold general parliamentary elections by the middle of next year. We are committed to doing all that is required to ensure that the election process is fully compatible with international standards for free and fair elections. To that end, we are committed to continuing to work with relevant specialized institutions on elections by fully implementing especially OSCE/Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) recommendations. For us, the process and standards are more important than the results of the elections. In the context of strengthening regional cooperation, my country is committed to a more enhanced partnership with all regional organizations and initiatives that serve the promotion of good neighbourly relations; the strengthening of regional peace, security and stability; ensuring political support for integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, and attracting financing for national and regional projects in priority fields such as energy, transportation and telecommunications. On its path towards European integration, the South-East European region is still facing pending challenges, such as the future of Kosovo. Albania greatly appreciates the recent democratic and integration developments in Kosovo, thanks to the efforts of the respective peoples and the partnership of its self-governing institutions with the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). Allow me at this point to congratulate Mr. Soren Jessen-Petersen, Special Representative for Kosovo of the United Nations Secretary-General, in assuming this very important duty.", "human1": "In a speech at the UN, Albania presents its work towards integration in NATO and adoption of European Union standards and collaborations ahead of general parliamentary elections the following year."}, "GUM_speech_data": {"fulltext": "When I tour around Taiwan, of course, I also find people taking action without even waiting for the ministries to take action. This is another of the g0v projects the environmental agency. If you change the O to a zero, you get into them, considering environmental agency. This is what people care about, the air quality, PM2.5 in Taiwan. More than 2,000 people, actually, installed these in their balconies, in their schools and so on, to get a real-time sensor of their IoT devices but not just IoT. They also upload it to the public cloud, which then uploads it to a distributed ledger to make sure that nobody can modify those numbers after the fact. After that, we see this kind of innovation is very rare in Asia. When I talk to all the UN-related bodies, many other Asian countries tell me that they won't let this network grow to be 2,000 nodes strong. If it's 200 nodes strong, they will try to poach the leader to the government. If they refuse, then maybe, they get disappeared because they really challenge the legitimacy of the environmental agency. If the environmental agency group reports one number and your neighbors report another number, of course, you're going to trust the one that you participated yourself, even though it's a lower quality sensor. Because of that, it's very rare in Taiwan because we have an expanding civic space. The government takes the approach of, \"we can't beat them, let's join them\". We manufacture low-cost, high-precision sensors for them, but we also see this as a map of digital gap in Taiwan, a digital divide. We set up points when the people don't have the resource to go to, indigenous places, places in the mountains. We also talk to the citizen scientists and they say they really want a point here to tell the air pollution from outside Taiwan or from inside Taiwan, domestically. There's no way the citizen scientists can install an AirBox there, even if they're very good at drones and so on. It's impossible to stay there forever. We can because we have wind turbines. That's electricity generators, power plants, over there. We can install those sensor networks as part of the complementary action. The beauty is this, it's all open hardware. It's all open source. It's on GitHub. You just download, put it onto Raspberry Pi, and then, you can do it yourself, as people have done over the world. If you don't change the source code, it uploads to the Taiwan network by default, so we kind of have the numbers of all the atmosphere and meteorological data. We have a website dedicated for this, the Civil IoT project at CI.taiwan.gov.tw, that is basically, collective intelligence, meteorological, air quality, earthquake, and disaster prevention, and things like that. We have single websites like this, CI for Collective Intelligence, AI for AI Taiwan, SI for Social Innovation, Smart Taiwan for the Smart Taiwan plan, and also, Bio Taiwan. The medical industry says, \"You really should call it biomed.taiwan because bio and med are different things.\" Biomed Taiwan goes to the same website as Bio Taiwan. In any case, what we're doing is now is breaking across ministry and municipality and national government because this says nothing about the level of the government or the departments. It is one, single message that is collaboratively curated by everybody. Through this, we solved not just our local social and environmental issues through economic approaches but using the SDGs as a map to unite the efforts together. Just by saying \"Taiwan can help\", we mean specifically, 17, 18, which is the availability of reliable data that people from across sectors, across jurisdictions, can trust the data. Then, based on the data, we encourage cross-sectoral partnerships. Then, based on that, we make open innovations that we, then, export, not as colonizers but, really, co-creators. Just download it on GitHub and then, we devise something together in a way that has free access to science and technology. When I joined the cabinet two years ago, based on these ideas -- with a contract -- the administration asked me for a job description, because they've never seen anything like this before. Instead of a job description, I just wrote them a poem, a prayer, which I'm going to read to you as a conclusion. To me, it means the shift from IT or ICT to digital, the shift from the sectors separately as attack or an innovation, or whatever, into the humanity as a whole. This is digital transformation for me. This is, literally, my job description. It goes like this. \"When we see the Internet of Things, let's make it an Internet of Beings. When we see virtual reality, let's make it a shared reality. When we see machine learning, let's make it collaborative learning. When we see user experience, let's make it about human experience, and whenever we hear that a singularity is near, let's keep in mind and always remember that a plurality is here.\" Thank you so much.", "human1": "In a speech, the digital minister of Taiwan discusses the technological cooperation between private citizens and the national government to gather atmospheric and meteorological data as well as other projects with similar private and public partnerships."}, "GUM_speech_destiny": {"fulltext": "A Tryst With Destiny Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's Inaugural Address 14 August 1947 Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity. At the dawn of history, India started on her unending quest, and trackless centuries are filled with her striving and grandeur of her success and failures. Through good and ill fortune alike, she has never lost sight of that quest, forgotten the ideals which gave her strength. We end today a period of misfortunes and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? Freedom and power bring responsibility. The responsibility rests upon this Assembly, a sovereign body representing the sovereign people of India. Before the birth of freedom, we have endured all the pains of labour and our hearts are heavy with the memory of this sorrrow. Some of those pains continue even now. Nevertheless, the past is over and it is the future that beckons us now. That future is not one of ease or resting but of incessant striving so that we may fulfill the pledges we have so often taken and the one we shall take today. The service of India means, the service of the millions who suffer. It means the ending of poverty and ignorance and poverty and disease and inequality of opportunity. The ambition of the greatest men of our generation has been to wipe every tear from every eye. That may be beyond us, but as long as there are tears and suffering, so long our work will not be over. And so we have to labour and to work, and to work hard, to give reality to our dreams. Those dreams are for India, but they are also for the world, for all the nations and peoples are too closely knit together today for any one of them to imagine that it can live apart. Peace is said to be indivisible, so is freedom, so is prosperity now, and also is disaster in this one world that can no longer be split into isolated fragments. To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for illwill or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell. The appointed day has come -the day appointed by destiny- and India stands forth again, after long slumber and struggle, awake, vital, free and independent. The past clings on to us still in some measure and we have to do much before we redeem the pledges we have so often taken. Yet the turning - point is past, and history begins anew for us, the history which we shall live and act and others will write about. It is a fateful moment for us in India, for all Asia and for the world. A new star rises, the star of freedom in the East, a new hope comes into being, a vision long cherished materializes. May the star never set and that hope never be betrayed! We rejoice in that freedom, even though clouds surround us, and many of our people are sorrowstricken and difficult problems encompass us. But freedom brings responsibilities and burdens and we have to face them in the spirit of a free and disciplined people. On this day our first thoughts go to the architect of this freedom, the Father of our Nation, who, embodying the old spirit of India, held aloft the torch of freedom and lighted up the darkness that surrounded us. We have often been unworthy followers of his and have strayed from his message, but not only we but succeeding generations will remember this message and bear the imprint in their hearts of this great son of India, magnificent in his faith and strength and courage and humility. We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest. Our next thoughts must be of the unknown volunteers and soldiers of freedom who, without praise or reward, have served India even unto death. We think also of our brothers and sisters who have been cut off from us by political boundaries and who unhappily can not share at present in the freedom that has come. They are of us and will remain of us whatever may happen, and we shall be sharers in their good [or] ill fortune alike. The future beckons to us. Whither do we go and what shall be our endeavour? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease; to build up a prosperous, democratic and progressive nation, and to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman. We have hard work ahead. There is no resting for any one of us till we redeem our pledge in full, till we make all the people of India what destiny intended them to be. We are citizens of a great country on the verge of bold advance, and we have to live up to that high standard. All of us, to whatever religion we may belong, are equally the children of India with equal rights, privileges and obligations. We cannot encourage communalism or narrow - mindedness, for no nation can be great whose people are narrow in thought or in action. To the nations and peoples of the world we send greetings and pledge ourselves to cooperate with them in furthering peace, freedom and democracy.

R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021. Below are the Speaker\u2019s remarks: Speaker Pelosi. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman from New York, the distinguished Chair of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding and for his leadership in bringing this important legislation to the Floor. And I commend Congresswoman Karen Bass, Madam Chair, for your great leadership in this important legislation. Madam Speaker, nearly one year ago, George Floyd gasped his last words, \u2018I can't breathe,\u2019 and ignited a nationwide reckoning on the racial injustice and police brutality in America. Americans from every corner of the country took to the streets to peacefully protest violence against Black Americans, waving Black Lives Matter flags, chanting the names of the murdered, repeating George Floyd's dying words, \u2018I can't breathe.\u2019 They turned their agony into action, but tragically, despite these mass protests, the injustice, killings continued. Those protests were global. They were all over the world. Here, as Members of Congress and as Americans, we cannot accept this epidemic of injustice. We cannot stay silent when one\u2013when our most vulnerable and historically marginalized communities, people of color, those living in poverty, Americans with disabilities are being targeted and sometimes killed. That is why, today, the House will again pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and send it to the Senate and the President's desk so that it can finally become the law of the land. I salute Congresswoman Karen Bass who has been relentless, persistent and absolutely courageous in her leadership on this legislation. Thank you to the Congressional Black Caucus and its Chair, Joyce Beatty. And Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, thank you. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act fundamentally transforms the culture of policing with strong, unprecedented reforms. This legislation will not erase centuries of systemic racism and excessive policing in America. It will not bring back George Floyd, Breonna Taylor\u2013say her name, Breonna Taylor\u2013Ahmaud Arbery, or the countless other men and women who died or were senselessly injured. But it will make a tremendous\u2013take a tremendous step toward\u2013or to stop the violence, stem the suffering and start to build a healthier, better relationship between law enforcement and communities that they respect. All of us here salute and are proudly, profoundly grateful to our law enforcement heroes. I grew up in a family, public service family. My father, my whole life at home, was Mayor of Baltimore. My brother was Mayor later, Thomas D\u2019Alesandro, in Baltimore. And they had a motto about the police: \u2018Be true to the men in blue.\u2019 Of course this was a long time ago and they were all men. \u2018Be true to the men in blue.\u2019 So, I was I was raised with that respect, with the \u2013 prayerfully that these people, our men and women, now, men and women in uniform, whether they're police or fire, but addressing police here, our first responders left home when they left to go to work, not knowing \u2013 their families not knowing if they would return home because they were risking their lives to save lives and to protect all of us. So, it\u2019s with great, prayerful gratitude to most of the men and women in blue, that we sadly have to say that our appreciation for them cannot lapse into apathy or acceptance of actions that are fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of policing, the purpose of policing. Of course, we all \u2013 there's not anyone on our side of the aisle who has advocated any policy in this body to defund the police, contrary to misrepresentations that are coming forth. All of us here, again, salute and profoundly grateful for our law enforcement heroes. As the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives writes, \u2018The passage of this act is paramount in achieving the fundamental principle of a police force that protects and serves every citizen of their community with fairness, accountability and transparency in their actions.\u2019 The Democratic Congress, together with the Biden-Harris Administration, is committed to not only ensuring that this legislation becomes law, but to take further action to end violence and advance justice in America. Let us ensure that the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is the first of many steps in this direction. To the family of George Floyd that came here when the bill was being reviewed by your committee, Mr Chairman \u2013 you remember that day. We couldn't be in your committee room because of COVID, but they came and they asked me that day, they said, \u2018Madam Speaker, will you name this bill for our brother?\u2019 Philonise, his brother, asked that question. I said, \u2018Only if you think it is worthy of your brother.\u2019 I think of George Floyd at least once a day \u2013 sometimes more. And you know why? Not just because of the sadness of it all, but I think of him because they tell us that in order to be safe from COVID, we must wash our hands for 20 seconds. As I'm washing my hands for 20 seconds, after about eight or nine seconds, I'm thinking \u2018This is taking forever. I can't do this for 20 seconds. It takes too long.\u2019 And then I think of George Floyd. Eight minutes and 46 seconds. That's a long time. It's a long time, as Congresswoman Dean said, calling out for his mother, extending love to his family. OK. Let us ensure that George's brother, Philonise, when he said, \u2018George's name means something,\u2019 and that, as his daughter, Gianna, said, \u2018Daddy changed the world\u2019 with this legislation. Let us take an important step in changing the world for George's family, for all communities of color, for all Americans, for the whole world. With that, Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I thank Karen Bass again, Madam Chair. Thank you so much, again. And I yield back the balance of my time.", "human1": "In this speech, Nancy Pelosi advocates in favor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, stating that this isn't a way for her to disminish the work of law enforcement, while also expressing sympathy towards George Floyd's family."}, "GUM_speech_humanitarian": {"fulltext": "The Charter of the United Nations sends a clear message to us all: put people first. The first words of the Charter, \u201cWe the peoples\u201d, are a summons to place people at the centre of our work \u2014 every day, everywhere. People with anxieties and aspirations, people with heartbreaks and hopes and, above all, people with rights. Those rights are not a favour to be rewarded or withheld; they are an endowment for simply being human. Throughout the first half of my mandate, I have had the good fortune to meet people around the world, not in gilded meeting rooms but where they live, work and dream. And I have listened. I have heard families in the South Pacific who fear their lives being swept away by rising seas; young refugees in the Middle East yearning for a return to school and home; Ebola survivors in North Kivu struggling to rebuild their lives; women demanding equality and opportunity; people of all beliefs and traditions who suffer simply because of who they are; and so many others. We are living in a world of disquiet. A great many people fear getting trampled, thwarted, left behind. Machines take their jobs, traffickers take their dignity, demagogues take their rights, warlords take their lives, fossil fuels take their futures. And yet people believe in the spirit and ideas that bring us to this Hall. They believe in the United Nations. But do they believe in us? Do they believe that, as leaders, we will put people first? We the leaders must deliver for we the peoples. People have the right to live in peace. One year ago in this Hall, I spoke of winds of hope despite the chaos and confusion of our world (see A/73/PV.6). Since then, some of those currents have continued to move in promising directions. Against the expectations of many, elections unfolded peacefully in Madagascar, the Maldives and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to name just a few places. Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia resolved their decades-long name dispute. Political dialogue in the Sudan and the peace process in the Central African Republic have brought renewed hope. A long-sought step forward has just been taken on the political path out of the tragedy in Syria, in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). As I announced yesterday, an agreement has been reached with all parties for a credible, balanced and inclusive Syrian-owned and Syrian-led constitutional committee. My Special Envoy just left Damascus after finalizing the last details with the Government and the opposition. The United Nations looks forward to convening the committee in Geneva in the coming weeks. However, across the global landscape, we see conflicts persisting, terrorism spreading and the risk of a new arms race growing. Outside interferences, often in violation of Security Council resolutions, make peace processes more difficult. Many situations remain unresolved, from Yemen and Libya to Afghanistan and beyond. A succession of unilateral actions threatens to thwart a two-State solution between Israel and Palestine. In Venezuela, 4 million people have fled the country \u2014 one of the largest displacements in the world. Tensions are heightened in South Asia, where differences need to be addressed through dialogue. Above all, we are facing the alarming possibility of armed conflict in the Gulf, the consequences of which the world can not afford. The recent attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities was completely unacceptable. In a context where a minor miscalculation can lead to a major confrontation, we must do everything possible to push for reason and restraint. I hope for a future in which all the countries of the region can live in a state of mutual respect and cooperation, without interference in each other\u2019s affairs. I hope equally that it will still be possible to preserve the progress on nuclear non-proliferation represented by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. From the first day, I have emphasized prevention, mediation and a surge in diplomacy for peace in order to address the crises that we face. Consider the lives that we can save by strengthening our investments to sustain peace around the world. Across some of the most troubled corners of the world, some 100,000 United Nations peacekeepers protect civilians and promote peace. Through the Action for Peacekeeping initiative, we are strengthening our effectiveness and efficiency and we are renewing partnerships with troop- and police-contributing countries, host countries and regional organizations, such as the African Union and the European Union. I am also proud of the work of our humanitarian workers, easing suffering around the world. Fully half of all international relief aid is channelled through the United Nations, ensuring that millions receive protection, food, medicine, shelter, water and other life-saving forms of assistance. This year alone, in brutal attacks and other circumstances, we have lost at least 80 peacekeepers, humanitarian workers and others, all of whom gave their lives serving the United Nations and trying to better the lives of others. I honour their service and their sacrifice. We have bolstered our counter-terrorism architecture and defined new strategies to tackle violent extremism and to address root causes, while respecting human rights. I have put forward a new disarmament agenda to advance global peace. In the near term, the New START Treaty must be extended. We must work to address the heightened threat posed by ballistic missiles and ensure a successful 2020 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The situation of the Korean peninsula remains uncertain. I fully support the efforts towards a new summit between the President of the United States and the leader of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. At this time of transition and dysfunction in global power relations, there is a new risk looming on the horizon that may not yet be large but it is real. I fear the possibility of a great fracture \u2014 the world splitting in two, with the two largest economies on Earth creating two separate and competing worlds, each with their own dominant currency, trade and financial rules, their own Internet and artificial intelligence capacities and their own zero-sum geopolitical and military strategies.

It is the oath created by Senators when they tried the first impeachment of a President in 1868. It is an oath rooted in the Revolution fought by their grandparents to create a republic of laws, not kings. It is an oath whose power derives from its common sense: that a juror must always be impartial for a trial to be fair. And it is an oath made necessary by the fact that Senators are not, as we are not, under normal circumstances, impartial in our work. The words chosen for this oath recognize that when our Constitution calls Senators to try impeachment, it calls them away from their role as partisans. When that oath is taken, Senators are supposed to step back from the affiliation of party or political kinship with or opposition to the President on trial. They are required, as the oath plainly states, to \"do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.\" Madam Speaker, this afternoon, Senators will be asked to vote on the two Articles of Impeachment the House presented on abuse of power and the obstruction of Congress. After voting to refuse to hear evidence and call witnesses with pertinent information, nearly all Republican Senators have already announced that they will vote against the articles. In doing so, many of them acknowledge that what President Trump did was wrong and inappropriate. They accept that it was wrong for him to withhold military aid to Ukraine until the President of that country promised to interfere in the American elections. The evidence of President Trump's abuse of power and attempt to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections is clear enough that Republican Senators cannot and have not denied the facts, yet they cannot bring themselves to confront this President and are choosing party over country. The Senator from Alaska, in explaining her decision to vote to block witnesses and evidence, tried to deflect responsibility from the consequences of her actions, writing: \"I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate.\" I agree with that. She further said: \"It is sad for me today to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.\" Madam Speaker, the Congress has not failed. The House did its job, whether you agree or not. In regular order, by a vote of this House, we impeached the President of the United States based upon our oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. The House did its job and did so with the solemnity required when undertaking the process of impeachment, which we did not seek but accepted as our responsibility under the Constitution. We held hearings, called witnesses, and subpoenaed documents. Many of the witnesses and documents, of course, were withheld by the White House. It is the Senate that will fail if Senators do not uphold their oaths to impartial justice. It is the Senate, Madam Speaker, that will fail if it does not hold this President accountable for using a hold on military aid to compel an ally to interfere in our election for his own personal gain. History will judge poorly those who choose fear of their party over the courage to do the right thing. Neither the Speaker nor myself, nor the whip, Jim Clyburn, urged any member in our party to vote any way on impeachment. There was no lobbying. There was no pressure. Our members voted consistent with their oath of office and the conviction that that vote was required by that oath to protect and defend the Constitution. Americans will judge. I am often asked why the House passed Articles of Impeachment even knowing that the odds were slim that Senate Republicans would set aside partisanship and hear the case as impartial jurors. It is because I know future generations will look back on this chapter in our history and ask: Who stood up for the Constitution and the laws? Who stood up for the values our Founders charged us to keep? Who refused to shrink from the heavy responsibilities of their oath? I can be proud that the House did its job, followed the law, defended our Constitution. We did not convict; that is not our role. Essentially, what we said was there was probable cause that powers had been abused and certainly cause to see that the President refused to cooperate with the constitutional responsibilities of the House of Representatives. I am also proud of the House managers, as all of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle are proud of our managers who made their case. They made their case with intellect. They made their case with evidence that had been adduced here in the House. They made their case and appealed to Senators to hold this President accountable, as our Founders intended. Almost everybody has watched a trial either in person or on television. A trial is not an opening argument and a closing argument with nothing in between. Seventy-five percent of our people wanted to have witnesses because that was their understanding of what a trial is, not just argument at the beginning and argument at the end, but evidence for jurors who have pledged to be impartial to consider. Any judge in this country would agree that opening and closing statements alone are not a trial. Nevertheless, the House managers proved their case. The truth is clear. The American people know what that truth is and know what this President has done. And they will remember who on this day abided by the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.", "human1": "In a speech in the US Congress, a Democratic member of Congress accuses Republican Senators of failing to fulfill their oath to conduct an impartial trial in the impeachment of President Donald Trump for abuse of power and attempts to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 elections."}, "GUM_speech_inauguration": {"fulltext": "Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion, and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely takes place, as it has for almost two centuries, and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the world, this every 4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle. Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic. The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people. Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery, and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity. But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals. You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we're not bound by that same limitation? We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding: We are going to begin to act, beginning today. The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They will go away because we as Americans have the capacity now, as we've had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom. In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price. We hear much of special interest groups. Well, our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we're sick \u2014 professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers. They are, in short, \"We the people,\" this breed called Americans. Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this \"new beginning,\" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America, at peace with itself and the world.", "human1": "In his inaugural address, US President Ronald Reagan praises the peaceful transition of power to a new Presidency and lays out his plans to reduce the role of government and spending in order to revive the economy and combat inflation and unemployment."}, "GUM_speech_maiden": {"fulltext": "CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u2014 SENATE S65 January 20, 2021 MAIDEN SPEECH Mr. President, I need to catch my breath, so much has happened. A few hours ago, on the West Front of this citadel of democracy, Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS were administered the oaths of Office to the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States. We have turned the page to a new chapter in the history of our democracy, and I am full of hope. I would challenge anyone not to feel hopeful today after listening to Amanda Gorman, the amazing 22\u2013year-old poet, wise far beyond her years, who told us that: Somehow we\u2019ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn\u2019t broken but simply unfinished The hope she spoke about\u2014the strong and happy hope\u2014 the hope we feel today, is a hope, of course, that is tempered by reality. This was an inauguration unlike most others. The crowds that customarily line the National Mall were absent, a reminder that our Nation is still in the throes of a deadly pandemic. The presence of thousands of National Guardsmen, police, and Secret Service was a reminder that 2 weeks ago, in this very room and on those very steps where President Biden took the oath, a mob of violent criminals tried to dismantle our democracy\u2014our sacred democracy\u2014brick by brick and would try again if they could. But, as President Biden said a few hours ago, today, democracy has prevailed, the will of the people was heeded, and the peaceful transfer of power fulfilled. It takes a lot more than a band of hooligans to bring our grand democracy down. Let it be a message to our friends and adversaries around the world that our democracy, though it has been tried and been tested, shall long endure. And let it be a message to those terrorists who desecrated this temple of democracy that they will never prevail. Joe Biden is now the 46th President of the United States. KAMALA HARRIS is now the 49th Vice President of the United States. But, of course, in more ways than one, she is not the 49th but the first\u2014the first African-American woman, the first Asian-American woman, and the first woman, period, to hold the Office of Vice Presidency in our Nation\u2019s history. Today, the threat to our democracy from the Presidency itself has ended, but the challenges we face as a nation remain. In the wake of violence and division, hatred and mistruth, in the shadow of disease and economic hardship, a warming planet and unequal society, we begin the work of the 117th Congress. In his inaugural address, President Biden spoke to this moment\u2014a moment of great challenge\u2014and told us two simple truths: One, that our responsibilities are numerous, and, two, it will take unity\u2014unity of spirit, unity of purpose\u2014to fulfill them. President Biden, we heard you loud and clear. We have a lengthy agenda, and we need to get it done together. President Biden pointed the way to our Nation\u2019s recovery and renewal. He reminded us of who we are and where we need to go, but we must now turn the spirit of his words into action. The Senate must immediately set to work on the mission President Biden described\u2014restoring the greatness and goodness of America. This will be an exceptionally busy and consequential period for the U.S. Senate. There is much to do, and we are ready to get to work. Now, not to upstage our new President and Vice President, but theirs has not been the only swearing in today. A few moments ago, the Senate welcomed three new Members to this Chamber. I can now happily and proudly call them Senator PADILLA, Senator OSSOFF, and Senator WARNOCK. They join Senators KELLY, HICKENLOOPER, and Luj\u00e1n as part of a six-Member class of Democratic Senators and a new Democratic Senate majority. I mention the historic nature of Vice President HARRIS\u2019 ascendance, but let\u2019s not forget that her successor, ALEX PADILLA, is the first Latino Senator to represent California; that RAFAEL WARNOCK, born while Georgia was represented in this Chamber by two staunch segregationists, is now the first African-American Senator Georgia has ever elected; and that JOHN OSSOFF is the first Jewish Senator from his State, sworn in today on a book of Hebrew Scripture once owned by the rabbi, who, decades ago, formed a bond between the Jewish and African-American communities of Georgia. As President Biden said in his inaugural address, \u201cdon\u2019t tell me things can\u2019t change.\u201d With the swearing in of these three Senators, the Senate will turn to Democratic control, for which I deeply thank my colleagues. We will return to Democratic control under the first New York-born majority leader in American history\u2014a kid from Brooklyn, the son of an exterminator and a housewife, and a descendant of victims of the Holocaust. That I should be the leader of this new Senate majority is an awesome responsibility\u2014awesome in the Biblical sense, as the angels that tremble in awe before God. Today, I feel the full weight of that responsibility, a sense of reverence and of awe at the trust placed in me. I intend to honor that trust with all of my energy and with joy. And as the majority changes in the Senate, the Senate will do business differently. The Senate will address the challenges our country faces head on and without delay, not with timid solutions but with boldness and with courage. The Senate will tackle the perils of the moment, a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis, and it will strive to make progress on generations-long struggle for racial justice, economic justice, equality of opportunity, and equality under the law. And make no mistake, the Senate will forcefully, consistently, and urgently address the greatest threat to this country and to our planet: climate change. This Senate will legislate. It will be active, responsive, energetic, and bold. And to my Republican colleagues, when and where we can, the Democratic majority will strive to make this important work bipartisan. The Senate works best when we work together. We have no choice. The challenges we face are great. The divisions in the country are real. We have no choice but to try to work together every day to reward the faith the American people have placed in us. So let us begin. I yield the floor.", "human1": "In his inaugural speech before the 117th Congress, the new Democratic Senate Majority Leader expresses his hopefulness after President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris's inauguration, welcomes new Democratic senators Padilla, Ossoff, and Warnock, and pledges that the Senate will legislate and be active, responsive, energetic, and bold."}, "GUM_speech_nixon": {"fulltext": "Address to the Nation Announcing Decision To Resign the Office of President of the United States August 08, 1974 Good evening: This is the 37th time I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this Nation. Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the national interest. In all the decisions I have made in my public life, I have always tried to do what was best for the Nation. Throughout the long and difficult period of Watergate, I have felt it was my duty to persevere, to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me. In the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that I no longer have a strong enough political base in the Congress to justify continuing that effort. As long as there was such a base, I felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future. But with the disappearance of that base, I now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served, and there is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged. I would have preferred to carry through to the finish, whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so. But the interests of the Nation must always come before any personal considerations. From the discussions I have had with Congressional and other leaders, I have concluded that because of the Watergate matter, I might not have the support of the Congress that I would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the Nation will require. I have never been a quitter. To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as President, I must put the interests of America first. America needs a full-time President and a full-time Congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad. To continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the President and the Congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home. Therefore, I shall resign the Presidency effective at noon tomorrow. Vice President Ford will be sworn in as President at that hour in this office. As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term, I feel a great sadness that I will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next 2 1/2 years. But in turning over direction of the Government to Vice President Ford, I know, as I told the Nation when I nominated him for that office 10 months ago, that the leadership of America will be in good hands. In passing this office to the Vice President, I also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow and, therefore, of the understanding, the patience, the cooperation he will need from all Americans. As he assumes that responsibility, he will deserve the help and the support of all of us. As we look to the future, the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this Nation, to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people. By taking this action, I hope that I will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in America. I regret deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision. I would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong--and some were wrong--they were made in what I believed at the time to be the best interest of the Nation. To those who have stood with me during these past difficult months--to my family, my friends, to many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right--I will be eternally grateful for your support. And to those who have not felt able to give me your support, let me say I leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, because all of us, in the final analysis, have been concerned with the good of the country, however our judgments might differ. So, let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new President succeed for the benefit of all Americans. I shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term, but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your President for the past 5 1/2 years. These years have been a momentous time in the history of our Nation and the world. They have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts of the Administration, the Congress, and the people. But the challenges ahead are equally great, and they, too, will require the support and the efforts of the Congress and the people working in cooperation with the new Administration. We have ended America's longest war, but in the work of securing a lasting peace in the world, the goals ahead are even more far-reaching and more difficult. We must complete a structure of peace so that it will be said of this generation, our generation of Americans, by the people of all nations, not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars. We have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the United States and the People's Republic of China. We must now ensure that the one quarter of the world's people who live in the People's Republic of China will be and remain not our enemies, but our friends.", "human1": "US President Richard Nixon announces his decision to resign due to the Watergate affair, resulting in Vice President Ford being sworn in as President the following day."}, "GUM_speech_remarks": {"fulltext": "I am proud to come here to Philadelphia and join my fellow Democrats. In 1960, the Democrats of this city produced a margin in the presidential race that was in this city three times as large as it was in the whole United States. So I am proud to be back here again, and I am very happy to be introduced by your distinguished chairman, Bill Green. When he became chairman of this city committee, there were 300,000 more Republicans registered in the city of Philadelphia than Democrats, and it is a source of satisfaction to me that tonight there are 260,000 more Democrats registered. I can understand why some Republicans may not like it, but, as a Democrat, as one who believes in the Democratic Party, as one who believes that the Democratic Party has meant progress for this city, this State, and this country, I am proud to be here in Philadelphia. And I am proud to be here with your mayor. I do not come from Philadelphia, and I would not interfere, but I am hopeful and confident that when we come to the Army - Navy game in a month from now, we will be greeted by the new mayor of Philadelphia, Mayor Tale. I haven't given a political speech for about 3 years, so I am a little out of practice, but I am gradually getting back into it. And I am glad to be here with a mayor who follows two other distinguished mayors of this city, who carries on their tradition - Joe Clark, your United States Senator who was a great mayor of Philadelphia, and Dick Dilworth, who followed him, who was a great mayor of Philadelphia. That is the tradition of honest, progressive democratic government that Mayor Tate carries on. And I am glad to be here with Judge Hoffman and Senator Mahady who also run this fall in the State of Pennsylvania. Everyone expects things of Presidents, but I am not sure that they realize how much depends upon the Members of the House and the Members of the Senate who must make the final judgment on what kind of laws a President must execute. The Congressmen from this city as well as the Senator from this State - Bill Barrett and Bob Nix and Herman Toll and Jim Byrne and Chairman Green - have, with Joe Clark supported legislation month in and month out that benefited this city and this State and this country and, what is more, has helped make the United States meet its responsibilities around the globe. So what you do in this city counts all across the country, and Philadelphia has sent the right men to the House of Representatives and to the Senate of the United States. And I am also proud to be here with your former Governor who is now working for us in Washington as our adviser on fair housing, Governor Dave Lawrence, of the State of Pennsylvania. Three years ago tomorrow night, I spoke in this hall in the closing days of the 1960 campaign, and I asked the people of this city to give us their support to help this country move again. The people of Philadelphia gave that support, and the support I received from this city and this State was, as it was in the 1960 convention, the key to our victory across the country. I am back in Philadelphia to express my thanks for that support and also to express appreciation for the help we received from those Democrats in this city and State, and to report to you on the progress that this country has made on the goals that were outlined 3 years ago. I did not promise on that October night that life would be easy in the Great Republic. I did not say we would not have new pressures and new problems. Nor did I speak of swift solutions in 100 days in office. I talked instead about the kind of America that I wanted for my family and for your family and all those who are citizens of this country in these difficult and changing years, the kind of America in which I believed, not as a Democrat or as a candidate, but as a citizen. Today, in many ways, the world looks very different, and the revolutionary change of pace is even more rapid than it has been in the past. But there has been no change in my concept of the goals which this country must strive for if it is to meet its responsibilities to its people and those who depend upon it. I still believe in the kind of America which I described in this hall 3 years ago, and I am still determined that this Nation shall continue to strive to meet those goals. And I am gratified to be able to report some progress in the last 33 1/2 months. I said, first of all, that I believed in America where work was available to those who were willing and able to work, where the waste of idle men and machines could be avoided, and where greater economic growth could provide the new jobs and the new markets that our growing Nation needed. That goal has not been fully achieved. There are still too many men and women, particularly young men and women, unable to find work. And our high wartime tax rates still prevent our economy from growing as fully and as freely as it must. But one fact is that 2 1/2 million people more are working in the United States than were working 33 months ago. The rate of unemployment and idle capacity has been cut, and our economy of the United States will shortly pass the $ 600 billion mark, for a record rise--for a record rise in 3 years of $ 100 billion--the largest peacetime rise in the history of the United States. And if we can obtain the early passage of an effective tax cut which the House of Representatives has already passed--and which the Ways and Means Committee, on which Bill Green serves, wrote--we shall be sailing this country next year on the longest and strongest peacetime expansion of our economy in the history of the United States.

It gives me great pleasure to be here today as the Chief Guest during the launch of School of Open \u2013 Africa. I would like to begin by sincerely thanking Creative Commons Africa community and under the able coordination of Alex Gakuru and Tobias Schonwetter, and the global Creative Commons Community for inviting me to preside over this launch. I am happy to note the enthusiasm demonstrated by School of Open Africa in transforming education along Sustainable Development Goals proposed for post-2015 (Goal No. 4: \u201cEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all\u201d) and in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 which seeks to transform Kenya into a middle-income country that offers high quality of life to all citizens by the year 2030. I am happy to note how much School of Open Africa has grown in Kenya and embraced in countries like Senegal, Nigeria, and South Africa among other African countries in the last few years. I am informed that School of Open by Creative Commons is highly reputed around the world for addressing universal access to education. Awarding CopyrightX certificates / CC BY / Phillip Ranja Kenya is a signatory to the UNESCO\u2019s 2012 Paris Declaration on Open Education Resources licensed under Creative Commons open licenses. The use of open education resources improves the quality of teaching and learning, including by accelerating student comprehension and by providing more opportunities for the realisation of universal access to education. Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and research materials in any medium that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Fully aware of the role of education in a country\u2019s development agenda, I am sure that the new initiatives being undertaken by School of Open Africa, the Creative Commons and UNESCO are making their contribution towards the social, economic, and political pillars which are the three fundamental cornerstones of our country, and indeed for our great continent. Ladies and gentlemen, as you may be aware, the Country\u2019s development blue print is being implemented through successive five- year Medium Term Plans (MTPs) that will finally enable the country to achieve the long-term goals. We are now in the second medium term plan cycle (2013 - 2017) whose theme is \u201cTransforming Kenya: Pathways to Devolution, Socio-economic Development, Equity and National Unity\u201d. As you may be aware, the ICT Authority rolled out the National ICT Master plan that will set the pace for progression of the country in ICT for the next five years. The Master plan \u2013 once fully rolled out \u2013 will completely transform government processes, services and management, and make information access and service delivery more efficient. Again, the Master plan, with the flagship projects to pilot its implementation, will steer the march towards the digital future that will transform the country to a regional technical hub, raise the country\u2019s competitiveness and align the country in line with vision 2030\u2019s ICT goals. By launching the Kenya ICT Master Plan, the government revealed its commitment towards the enhancement of access to quality education and training through ICT in line with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are reviewing the National ICT Policy Guidelines to ensure alignment with proposed Sustainable Development Goals. As a country, we are also privileged to have a National ICT Policy whose goal is to create a prosperous ICT - driven Kenyan society. With a well mainstreamed ICT society, we are assured of better livelihoods of Kenyans attainable through the availability of accessible, efficient, reliable and affordable ICT services. ICT provides a platform that enables the realization of these goals. I must emphasize that Creative Commons through the School of Open Africa has provided a good example of innovative use of ICT in education that resonates well with the Kenya National ICT Master Plan. The integration of ICT into educational programmes places both the teaching staff and students at the forefront in the utilization of ICT for the enhancement of lives. I note with great pleasure the freedom to re-purpose offered by openly licensed educational resources, the convenience online access to learners as alternative courses delivery and certification methods. At this juncture, ladies and gentlemen, I thank William Fisher III, Professor of Intellectual Property and his staff at the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School for providing a free copyright law course taught to graduands present today to receive their certificates. I also thank Michael Murungi (then CEO, National Council for Law Reporting or \u201cKenya Law\u201d) and Alex Gakuru for successfully conducting the course in Nairobi. I must congratulate the former students and ask to make the very best use of the copyright law knowledge they acquired while also challenging all universities represented here to consider emulating the highly successfully CopyrightX initiative. As the government continues to work on modalities of ensuring universal access to education and increasing the internet penetration in all parts of the country, we are pleased to witness this mode of study that will definitely translate to affordable education. Open Education Resources coupled with innovative use of ICT in education will accelerate realization of a modern Kenya that will be a knowledge-based economy. By using Open Educational Resources, OER, School of Open is opening up to many students who would have otherwise missed the opportunity of accessing education, especially in the marginalized areas which could not adequately access quality education. Ongoing, voluntary, and self- motivated pursuit of knowledge for either personal or professional reasons is one of the characteristics of the 21st Century. One of the major ways of promoting life-long learning is the continuous use of ICT innovations in education. I congratulate School of Open teams across Africa for the innovative and transformative mode of teaching and learning that we are launching today. This African initiative is a worthy model for other regions of the world to emulate. As I conclude I take this opportunity to applaud UNESCO\u2019s efforts and contribution in the development and growth of the country through this noble initiative that enables the primary, secondary and universities to optimize the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in learning.

President Joe Biden and I talk often about our mutual passion for everything you all do. This is a very exciting moment to join you for the unveiling of the work that you have been laboring on for decades. So, to our President, Joe Biden, thank you for your leadership around all of these issues.

Thank you also to our colleagues from across the White House and NASA and everyone else joining us from home. So, yes, as Chair of the National Space Council, I know that today represents an exciting new chapter in the exploration of our universe. From the beginning of history, humans have looked up to the night sky with wonder. And thanks to dedicated people who have been working for decades in engineering and on scientific marvels, we can look to the sky with new understanding. When NASA launched the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, we were able to see the stars unobstructed by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and understand the universe in ways we could have never imagined even a few decades earlier. And now we enter a new phase of scientific discovery. Building on the legacy of Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope allows us to see deeper into space than ever before and in stunning clarity. It will enhance what we know about the origins of our universe, our solar system, and possibly life itself. This was made possible by partnership among nations. And it is an example of how the scientific endeavor can build upon the international rules and norms that govern our cooperation in space. This telescope is one of humanity\u2019s great engineering achievements. And the images we will see today are a testament to the amazing work done by the thousands of workers across our nation who dedicated years to this project. They embarked on this complex endeavor for the benefit of humankind, and in the process, accelerated American innovation, strengthened partnerships with our allies, and will undoubtedly inspire generations to look to the heavens with excitement and ambition. With that, it is my great honor to introduce a leader who has always believed in the power of American innovation and international cooperation to achieve the remarkable: our President, the President of the United States, Joe Biden. THE PRESIDENT: Well, it\u2019s great to be with you all. And I was going to say \u201cgood afternoon,\u201d but we\u2019re starting this meeting late because I was engaged in preparing for a trip to the Middle East. But today is a historic day. And thank you, Vice President Harris, Chair of the National Space Council. And thank you, my dear friend and our outstanding NASA Administrator and the guy\u2014the only guy here who\u2019s been in space, Bill Nelson. Bill, you\u2019re a good friend. Thank you very much for what you\u2019re doing. And\u2014and, Dr. Nelson, you\u2019re doing a great job leading this Office of Science and Technology Policy. It really is a matter\u2014it really is amazing. Six and a half months ago, a rocket launched from Earth carrying the world\u2019s newest, most powerful deep-space telescope on a journey one million miles into the cosmos\u2014first of all, that blows my mind: a million miles into the cosmos\u2014along the way unfolding itself, deploying a mirror 21 feet wide, a sunshield the size of a tennis court, and 250,000 tiny shutters, each one smaller than a grain of sand. Put together, it\u2019s a new window into the history of our universe. And today, we\u2019re going to get a glimpse of the first light to shine through that window\u2014light from other worlds, orbiting stars far beyond our own. It\u2019s astounding to me when I read this and saw the\u2014I mean, it really is. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s\u2014anyway, I don\u2019t want to\u2014I\u2019ll see what they think when we see this. But light where stars were born and from where they die. Light from the oldest galaxies. The oldest documented light in the history of the universe from over 13 billion\u2014let me say that again: 13 billion years ago. It\u2019s hard to even fathom. Tomorrow, when this image is shared with the world, it will be a historic moment for science and technology, for astronomy and space exploration, for America and all of humanity. You know, as an international collaboration, this telescope embodies how America leads the world not by the example of our power, but the power of our example. A partnership with others, it symbolizes the relentless spirit of American ingenuity. And it shows what we can achieve, what more we can discover, not just about distant places, but about our very own planet and climate, like NASA\u2019s Earth System Observatory that we launched last year. That\u2019s why the federal government must invest\u2014must invest in science and technology, more than we have in the past. These images are going to remind the world that America can do big things. And they\u2019ll remind the American people, especially our children, that there\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity\u2014nothing beyond our capacity. We can see possibilities no one has ever seen before. We can go places no one has ever gone before. You know, you\u2019ve\u2014you\u2019ve heard me say it over and over again. America is defined by one single word: possibilities. Possibilities. I want to thank the team at NASA for once again showing that that\u2019s who we are\u2014that\u2019s who we are as a nation: a nation of possibilities.

They didn't know the air-conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. We want Trump. We want Trump. When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time. When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically. The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest.

They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken. So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19 \u2014 and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said \u2014 and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, \"Don't hit Iraq,\" because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league. We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love \u2014 they're great \u2014 all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers. And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing.

Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product \u2014 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero.

They brought American traditions and expectations with them (including, for many, the right to own slaves). For instance, the majority of these new settlers were Protestant, and though they were not required to attend the Catholic mass, Mexico's prohibition on the public practice of other religions upset them and they routinely ignored it. Accustomed to representative democracy, jury trials, and the defendant\u2019s right to appear before a judge, the Anglo-American settlers in Texas also disliked the Mexican legal system, which provided for an initial hearing by an alcalde, an administrator who often combined the duties of mayor, judge, and law enforcement officer. The alcalde sent a written record of the proceeding to a judge in Saltillo, the state capital, who decided the outcome. Settlers also resented that at most two Texas representatives were allowed in the state legislature. Their greatest source of discontent, though, was the Mexican government's 1829 abolition of slavery. Most American settlers were from southern states, and many had brought slaves with them. Mexico tried to accommodate them by maintaining the fiction that the slaves were indentured servants. But American slaveholders in Texas distrusted the Mexican government and wanted Texas to be a new U.S. slave state. The dislike of most for Roman Catholicism (the prevailing religion of Mexico) and a widely held belief in American racial superiority led them generally to regard Mexicans as dishonest, ignorant, and backward. Figure 1.3 This 1833 map shows the extent of land grants made by Mexico to American settlers in Texas. Nearly all are in the eastern portion of the state, one factor that led to war with Mexico in 1846. Image credit: Holley (Armstrong & Plaskitt), Public Domain Belief in their own superiority inspired some Texans to try to undermine the power of the Mexican government. When empresario Haden Edwards attempted to evict people who had settled his land grant before he gained title to it, the Mexican government nullified its agreement with him. Outraged, Edwards and a small party of men took prisoner the alcalde of Nacogdoches. The Mexican army marched to the town, and Edwards and his troops then declared the formation of the Republic of Fredonia between the Sabine and Rio Grande Rivers. To demonstrate loyalty to their adopted country, a force led by Stephen Austin hastened to Nacogdoches to support the Mexican army. Edwards\u2019s revolt collapsed, and the revolutionaries fled Texas. The growing presence of American settlers in Texas, their reluctance to abide by Mexican law, and their desire for independence caused the Mexican government to grow wary. In 1830, it forbade future U.S. immigration and increased its military presence in Texas. Settlers continued to stream illegally across the long border; by 1835, after immigration resumed, there were twenty thousand Anglo-Americans in Texas. Fifty-five delegates from the Anglo-American settlements gathered in 1831 to demand the suspension of customs duties, the resumption of immigration from the United States, better protection from Indian tribes, the granting of promised land titles, and the creation of an independent state of Texas separate from Coahuila. Ordered to disband, the delegates reconvened in early April 1833 to write a constitution for an independent Texas. Surprisingly, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, Mexico\u2019s new president, agreed to all demands, except the call for statehood. Coahuila y Texas made provisions for jury trials, increased Texas\u2019s representation in the state legislature, and removed restrictions on commerce. Figure 1.4 This portrait of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna depicts the Mexican president and general in full military regalia. Image credit: Public Domain Texans' hopes for independence were quashed in 1834, however, when Santa Anna dismissed the Mexican Congress and abolished all state governments, including that of Coahuila y Texas. In January 1835, reneging on earlier promises, he dispatched troops to the town of Anahuac to collect customs duties. Lawyer and soldier William B. Travis and a small force marched on Anahuac in June, and the fort surrendered. On October 2, Anglo-American forces met Mexican troops at the town of Gonzales; the Mexican troops fled and the Americans moved on to take San Antonio. Now more cautious, delegates to the Consultation of 1835 at San Felipe de Austin voted against declaring independence, instead drafting a statement, which became known as the Declaration of Causes, promising continued loyalty if Mexico returned to a constitutional form of government. They selected Henry Smith, leader of the Independence Party, as governor of Texas and placed Sam Houston, a former soldier who had been a congressman and governor of Tennessee, in charge of its small military force. The Consultation delegates met again in March 1836. They declared their independence from Mexico and drafted a constitution calling for an American-style judicial system and an elected president and legislature. Significantly, they also established that slavery would not be prohibited in Texas. Many wealthy Tejanos supported the push for independence, hoping for liberal governmental reforms and economic benefits. Remember the Alamo! Mexico had no intention of losing its northern province. Santa Anna and his army of four thousand had besieged San Antonio in February 1836. Hopelessly outnumbered, its two hundred defenders, under Travis, fought fiercely from their refuge in an old mission known as the Alamo. After ten days, however, the mission was taken and all but a few of the defenders were dead, including Travis and James Bowie, the famed frontiersman who was also a land speculator and slave trader. A few male survivors, possibly including the frontier legend and former Tennessee congressman Davy Crockett, were led outside the walls and executed. The few women and children inside the mission were allowed to leave with the only adult male survivor, a slave owned by Travis who was then freed by the Mexican Army. Terrified, they fled.

A student comes to class one day, and the instructor says, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that you\u2019re all a bunch of failures and I\u2019m flunking the entire class.\u201d Imagine then that the instructor simply stands there after that announcement, blinking calmly as the class erupts in protest. Now imagine that same scenario with one very slight difference. The instructor announces, \u201cI\u2019ve decided that you\u2019re all a bunch of failures and I\u2019m flunking the entire class.\u201d Then, as the class erupts in protest, the instructor calmly blinks one eye, leaving the other eye open. Figure 3.4 Would you take this woman seriously? In American culture, winking, related to the normal biological function of blinking, takes on special meaning in social interactions. (credit: Motion Picture News/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain) What just happened there? Blinking is a biological compulsion common to humans everywhere. Humans blink to keep eyes hydrated and clear of debris. Humans are born knowing how to blink; nobody has to teach us. On average, humans blink 15 to 20 times every minute. Without realizing it, people are necessarily blinking throughout every conversation, every social interaction, every activity during the day. The people we talk to and interact with are also blinking constantly, so often that everyone is accustomed to ignoring it. Blinking does not affect the perceived meaning of speech or actions. But if someone deliberately blinks one eye, leaving the other one open, that\u2019s a completely different matter. In fact, leaving one eye open makes a blink a wink. Winking is not a biological necessity. Humans are not born knowing to how to wink, and it takes some practice to learn how to do it. Because it requires deliberate effort and people are not constantly doing it, winking can acquire special meaning in social interactions. In American culture (and many others), a wink often indicates that someone is joking around and that whatever they\u2019ve just said or done should not be taken seriously. Of course, a wink can mean different things in different societies. Moreover, a wink can mean different things in the same society. If someone on a date takes their companion\u2019s hand and gives a cute little wink, the person may have reason to hope the winker is not just joking around. American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz (1973) used the example of winking to illustrate two important aspects of culture. First, culture is learned. Innate human behaviors\u2014that is, behaviors that people are born with\u2014are biological, not cultural. Blinking is biological. Acquired human behaviors\u2014that is, behaviors that people are taught\u2014are cultural. Winking is cultural. This means that cultural behaviors are not genetically inherited from generation to generation but must be passed down from older members of a society to younger members. This process, as you\u2019ll recall from What is Anthropology? is called enculturation. Some aspects of enculturation are deliberate and systematic, such as learning the rules of written punctuation in a language. At some point in an English speaker\u2019s childhood, someone explicitly told them the difference between a question mark and an exclamation point. Most likely, they learned this distinction in school, a fundamental institution of enculturation in many societies. Religious institutions are another common force of enculturation, providing explicit instruction in cultural rules of morality and social interaction. Extracurricular activities such as sports, dance, and music lessons also teach children cultural rules and norms. While a great deal of very important cultural content is deliberately conveyed in these systematic contexts, the greater part of culture is acquired unconsciously by happenstance\u2014that is, nobody planned to teach it, and no one made an effort to consciously try to learn it. By virtue of growing up in a culture, children learn what certain actions and objects mean, how their society operates, and what the rules are for appropriate behavior. Going back to the cultural notion of home, did anyone ever explain to you why your childhood home was structured in a certain way? Did anyone ever point out the cultural assumptions about gender and family built into your house? Probably not. Now, imagine that you were taken away from your parents as a baby and adopted by a family far away, with a very different way of life situated in a very different environment. With your adoptive family, you might have been raised in a very different kind of home. Growing up, your everyday habits, activities, and expectations would have been shaped by the setup of that home. Living in that house, you would have wordlessly absorbed a set of assumptions about family, gender, work, leisure, hospitality, and property. And all of it would seem quite natural to you. Many forms of culture are passed down through a combination of deliberate and unconscious processes. Perhaps when you were a child, someone told you what a wink was and showed you how to accomplish one; or perhaps you just witnessed a few winks, figured out what they meant from their contexts, and then learned how to accomplish one through trial and error. Geertz pointed out that there are two important aspects to winking: the meaning and the action. As both are learned, both are cultural. But perhaps more importantly, both the standardized action of winking and the assumed meaning of this action are commonly known among members of a group. That is, culture is shared.", "human1": "This textbook excerpt describes the cultural acquisition and functions of winking in contrast with the innate biological function of blinking and illustrates how enculturation takes place both deliberately through institutions such as schools, and by happenstance through exposure to cultural assumptions growing up."}, "GUM_textbook_artwork": {"fulltext": "A relevant question to our concern might be, would this artistic excellence in the Chinese tradition be the same as beauty? Arguably, beauty is regarded as the keyword in Western art tradition since antiquity. If we browse Chinese classical writings on art criticism, a striking difference manifests \u2014 there the category of mei or beauty does not have a dominant presence. For instance, among the 24 aesthetic categories of poetry listed by Sikong Tu \u53f8\u7a7a\u56fe (837\u2013908) in his celebrated treatise (Sikong n.d.), only three or four categories can be regarded as related to the Western notion of beauty. Moreover, according to Xu Hong\u2019s (c. 1580\u20131660) Xishan Qinkuang \u8c3f\u5c71\u7434\u51b5 (c. 1640), the most influential treatise on the aesthetics of guqin (Chinese zither) music, the category of li (pretty, beautiful) is merely the 10th of the 24 aesthetic categories, and the top six were harmony, tranquillity, clarity, profundity, antiquity, subtlety. [38] In Chinese paintings, prominence was given to the categories such as shen (spiritual) and miao (subtle) before mei. Overall, one also finds that the comparison between the beautiful and the sublime \u2014 which defined the influential aesthetics of Edmund Burke (1729\u20131797) and Immanuel Kant, and consequently became an iconic discourse in Western aesthetics \u2014 is also missing in the Chinese history of aesthetics. To conclude, in a cross-cultural comparative context, it is fair to say that an inquiry on what makes an artwork beautiful may turn out to be even less productive than in the contemporary artworld. 38. \u548c, \u9759, \u6e05, \u8fdc, \u53e4, \u6fb9 (Research Institute of Music 2010, vol.14, 316\u2013321). CONTEMPORARY DISCOURSE: BRIEF REMARK The Hegelian definition of aesthetics as the philosophy of art that considers the issue of artistic beauty as its core concern is no more enchanting in our time. Many would agree that the question \u201cwhat makes an artwork beautiful\u201d plays a minor role in contemporary aesthetics and philosophy of art, where the question has been updated to \u201cwhat makes an artwork meaningful or valuable?\u201d Two factors might contribute to this situation. Firstly, it is not a coincidence that the loss of interest in the inquiry into artistic beauty coincides with a sea change in the artworld, transformed by new art movements as well as struggles in defining art. Being beautiful is no longer a defining feature of art. Also, when the representationalism, the expression theories, formalism, neoformalism, aesthetic theories in defining art all fail to offer an account that is capable of coping with the dynamic scenes of the artworld, and when the anti-essentialist movement in philosophical aesthetics then paves a way to functionalism, institutionalism and various versions of historicism, the question of artistic beauty as such not only loses its limelight, but also is, to some extent, abandoned for its strong Hegelian colour. Now if \u201cart\u201d itself becomes an open concept or a socially, historically, culturally sensitive notion, then whatever makes an artwork beautiful is unlikely to be something homogeneous and unitary. Secondly, the inquiry into \u201cbeauty\u201d experienced a shift of focus from the emphasis on aesthetic properties of the objects to the subjective experience involved in aesthetic appreciation. In other words, a shift from an inquiry about \u201cthe beauty of object\u201d to the issue of \u201cthe pleasure of beauty.\u201d The contemporary inquiry into beauty in general is often classified in light of the framework of realism vs non-realism. Realism regards artistic beauty as a property of artworks which is independent of the subject, while non-realism holds that artistic beauty is not an independent property of artworks. This shift has a long historical preparation, contributed especially by the British empiricists such as Francis Hutcheson (1694\u20131746) and David Hume (1711\u20131776). Hutcheson thinks that beauty lies in both the object and the subject, and artistic beauty comes from the quality of \u201cuniformity amidst variety\u201d in the object and the involvement of an \u201cinternal sense\u201d in the subject. [39] Hume argues that \u201cbeauty is no quality in things themselves,\u201d but a \u201csentiment\u201d in \u201cthe mind that contemplates them\u201d and \u201cto seek the real beauty \u2026 is \u2026 fruitless.\u201d [40] In contemporary aesthetics, from the study of empathy to Freud\u2019s libido, to the evolutionary theory of beauty, to the focus on perception in aesthetic experience, more and more philosophers seek to answer the question of what makes an artwork beautiful in light of human physiology and psychology. For instance, the evolutionary theory regards artistic beauty as \u201cfitness signal\u201d that displays desirable personal qualities that strengthen reproductive advantage, and our pleasant feeling caused by something beautiful, like sexual pleasure, is engraved in our minds by the process of evolution, assisting us to make the \u201cthe most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction.\u201d [41] 39. \u201cThe Figures which excite in us the Ideas of Beauty, seem to be those in which there is Uniformity amidst Variety\u201d (\u00a7 II, p. 28). \u201cThe internal Sense is, a passive Power of receiving Ideas of Beauty from all Objects in which there is Uniformity amidst Variety\u201d (\u00a7 VI, 67). 40. \u201cBeauty is no quality in things themselves: it exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty \u2026 every individual ought to acquiesce in his own sentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. To seek the real beauty, or real deformity, is as fruitless an inquiry, as to pretend to ascertain the real sweet or real bitter\u201d (Hume 1998, 136\u2013137). 41. Denis Dutton (2010) provides such an account in his TED talk, \u201cA Darwinian Theory of Beauty.\u201d", "human1": "This section of a philosophy textbook first examines classical Chinese aesthetic theory and posits that what makes artwork beautiful may not be beauty itself, the dominant thought in Western art tradition, before commenting on the shift in contemporary notions of what makes artwork beautiful, such as the experience of the subject appreciating the artwork."}, "GUM_textbook_cognition": {"fulltext": "Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe cognition Distinguish concepts and prototypes Explain the difference between natural and artificial concepts Imagine all of your thoughts as if they were physical entities, swirling rapidly inside your mind. How is it possible that the brain is able to move from one thought to the next in an organized, orderly fashion? The brain is endlessly perceiving, processing, planning, organizing, and remembering\u2014it is always active. Yet, you don\u2019t notice most of your brain\u2019s activity as you move throughout your daily routine. This is only one facet of the complex processes involved in cognition. Simply put, cognition is thinking, and it encompasses the processes associated with perception, knowledge, problem solving, judgment, language, and memory. Scientists who study cognition are searching for ways to understand how we integrate, organize, and utilize our conscious cognitive experiences without being aware of all of the unconscious work that our brains are doing (for example, Kahneman, 2011). Cognition Upon waking each morning, you begin thinking\u2014contemplating the tasks that you must complete that day. In what order should you run your errands? Should you go to the bank, the cleaners, or the grocery store first? Can you get these things done before you head to class or will they need to wait until school is done? These thoughts are one example of cognition at work. Exceptionally complex, cognition is an essential feature of human consciousness, yet not all aspects of cognition are consciously experienced. Cognitive psychology is the field of psychology dedicated to examining how people think. It attempts to explain how and why we think the way we do by studying the interactions among human thinking, emotion, creativity, language, and problem solving, in addition to other cognitive processes. Cognitive psychologists strive to determine and measure different types of intelligence, why some people are better at problem solving than others, and how emotional intelligence affects success in the workplace, among countless other topics. They also sometimes focus on how we organize thoughts and information gathered from our environments into meaningful categories of thought, which will be discussed later. Concepts and Prototypes The human nervous system is capable of handling endless streams of information. The senses serve as the interface between the mind and the external environment, receiving stimuli and translating it into nervous impulses that are transmitted to the brain. The brain then processes this information and uses the relevant pieces to create thoughts, which can then be expressed through language or stored in memory for future use. To make this process more complex, the brain does not gather information from external environments only. When thoughts are formed, the brain also pulls information from emotions and memories (Figure 7.2). Emotion and memory are powerful influences on both our thoughts and behaviors. Figure 7.2 Sensations and information are received by our brains, filtered through emotions and memories, and processed to become thoughts. In order to organize this staggering amount of information, the brain has developed a file cabinet of sorts in the mind. The different files stored in the file cabinet are called concepts. Concepts are categories or groupings of linguistic information, images, ideas, or memories, such as life experiences. Concepts are, in many ways, big ideas that are generated by observing details, and categorizing and combining these details into cognitive structures. You use concepts to see the relationships among the different elements of your experiences and to keep the information in your mind organized and accessible. Concepts are informed by our semantic memory (you will learn more about semantic memory in a later chapter) and are present in every aspect of our lives; however, one of the easiest places to notice concepts is inside a classroom, where they are discussed explicitly. When you study United States history, for example, you learn about more than just individual events that have happened in America\u2019s past. You absorb a large quantity of information by listening to and participating in discussions, examining maps, and reading first-hand accounts of people\u2019s lives. Your brain analyzes these details and develops an overall understanding of American history. In the process, your brain gathers details that inform and refine your understanding of related concepts like democracy, power, and freedom. Concepts can be complex and abstract, like justice, or more concrete, like types of birds. In psychology, for example, Piaget\u2019s stages of development are abstract concepts. Some concepts, like tolerance, are agreed upon by many people, because they have been used in various ways over many years. Other concepts, like the characteristics of your ideal friend or your family\u2019s birthday traditions, are personal and individualized. In this way, concepts touch every aspect of our lives, from our many daily routines to the guiding principles behind the way governments function. Another technique used by your brain to organize information is the identification of prototypes for the concepts you have developed. A prototype is the best example or representation of a concept. For example, for the category of civil disobedience, your prototype could be Rosa Parks. Her peaceful resistance to segregation on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, is a recognizable example of civil disobedience. Or your prototype could be Mohandas Gandhi, sometimes called Mahatma Gandhi (\u201cMahatma\u201d is an honorific title) (Figure 7.3). Figure 7.3 In 1930, Mohandas Gandhi led a group in peaceful protest against a British tax on salt in India. Mohandas Gandhi served as a nonviolent force for independence for India while simultaneously demanding that Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Christian leaders\u2014both Indian and British\u2014collaborate peacefully. Although he was not always successful in preventing violence around him, his life provides a steadfast example of the civil disobedience prototype (Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2013). Just as concepts can be abstract or concrete, we can make a distinction between concepts that are functions of our direct experience with the world and those that are more artificial in nature.", "human1": "This excerpt from a psychology textbook explains how the brain uses abstract concepts, such as 'democracy', and prototypes like Rosa Parks or Mahatma Gandhi for categories such as 'civil disobedience', in order to organize the large amounts of information in sensory experience."}, "GUM_textbook_entrepreneurship": {"fulltext": "An Entrepreneurial Mindset in Your Discipline or Field Within your industry of interest or area of study, what are the challenges that create frustration? How can these be turned into opportunities? Earlier in this chapter, we discussed Evernote, a company that focuses on expanding our memories by storing and organizing information. Let\u2019s look at some other examples of entrepreneurial endeavors in specific industries to help you plan your own venture in your own industry. In the agriculture industry, insects, weeds, weather conditions, and the challenges of harvesting crops are all ripe for entrepreneurial activities. The move toward organic produce has also affected this industry. From an entrepreneurial perspective, what products could you invent to support both organic farming and the problems of insects that damage or destroy crops? The old method was to use chemical sprays to kill the insects, but today, the growing demand for organic foods and increased awareness of the impact of chemical sprays on our environment are changing this scenario. One new idea to solve this problem combines a vacuum cleaner with an agriculture product. LINK TO LEARNING Watch this video on the creation of a crop vacuum that sucks up insects and bugs to learn more. A bug vacuum is an example of how using divergent thinking contributed to the solution of removing bugs from crops without using chemicals. In the group activity of creating divergent ideas, this idea may not have been received well. However, in the incubation stage, the idea must have come forward as a viable solution. Entrepreneurs frequently face the challenge of pressure to conform to established habits and patterns within industries. Often, the entrepreneurial mindset includes futuristic ideas that shake up the normal, conventional processes that are grounded in experience over time. Tried-and-tested processes and products that have a proven history of success can be a formidable obstacle to new ideas. A new idea may even appear as impossible or outlandish, perhaps even an embarrassment to the steady and predictable practices established within an industry. This can create a dilemma: Do we try something new and unproven that lacks documented research? Sometimes, we must disregard our past successes and research to be open to new possibilities for success and failure. An entrepreneurial mindset includes creativity, problem-solving skills, and a propensity to innovation.23 Open-mindedness is one characteristic that supports creativity, problem solving, and innovation. Taking the time to explore new ideas, dream, reflect, and view situations from a new perspective contribute to the entrepreneurial mindset. Some innovations can lead to disruptions within the industry, or even create a new industry. The innovator\u2019s dilemma was presented by Clayton Christensen to explain disruptive technology, which are technologies that, once introduced, displace established patterns, processes, and systems previously accepted as normal or accepted. One example of a disruptive technology is Airbnb, a company that threatens the established hotel industry by connecting personal resources to people who desire those resources. If you have a spare bedroom that you aren\u2019t using, why not sell that space to someone who wants and needs the space? Airbnb has become a significant threat to the established hotel industry\u2019s business model of building large hotels and renting rooms within those hotels to their customers. Airbnb has reconfigured that model, and since its 2008 launch, 150 million travelers have taken advantage of 3 million Airbnb listings in more than 191 countries. Airbnb has raised more than $3 billion (plus a $1 billion credit line) and is considering selling stocks to support significant expansion. The value of Airbnb is approximately $30 billion. Compare this market value to Hilton\u2019s market capitalization of $19 billion and Marriott\u2019s of $35 billion. If you were the CEO of Hilton or Marriott, would you be worried? The hotel industry recognized Airbnb as a threat, and in 2016, began a campaign to create legislation to rein in Airbnb\u2019s growth and popularity. From the hotel industry\u2019s perspective, Airbnb is not playing by the same rules. This is the definition of disruptive technology, the focus on creating a new idea or process that negates or challenges established process or products.24 Sometimes disruptive technologies result from not listening to customers. Customers don\u2019t always know what they want. Customer groups might need to be redefined by the entrepreneurial team on the basis of better models, knowing when to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins while still satisfying the need, and knowing when to pursue small markets at the expense of larger or established markets. Basically, disruptive technologies occur through identifying new and valuable processes and products. The founders of Airbnb recognized that some people have unused resources, bedrooms, that other people need. We can apply this idea to other unused resources such as vehicles and motor homes. We see this model reproduced in short-term car rental and bike-sharing programs.

So far, we have covered how evolutionary ethics relates to the question what we ought to do and why we are moral in the first place. A related set of questions about ethics are metaethical questions, which concern the meaning of moral terms, our ways of gaining knowledge of moral facts, and the nature of the moral facts. In other words, apart from thinking about how we ought to live, and where our moral sense comes from, we can also ask what it means to affirm a particular answer to that question, how we could come to know the answer, and whether the answer would be a matter of fact or more like an opinion. Many books and articles in moral philosophy start with the observation that moral judgments seem to be objectively true and the assumption that this is how non-philosophers also think about morality. For example, Michael Smith writes: We seem to think moral questions have correct answers; that the correct answers are made correct by objective moral facts; that moral facts are wholly determined by circumstances; and that, by engaging in moral conversation and argument, we can discover what these objective facts are. (Smith 1994, 6) But as we have seen above, evolutionary theory explains why we would think that moral judgments are objective. The philosopher Michael Ruse takes this to show that the apparent objectivity of morality is something like an \u201cillusion\u201d foisted on us by our genes (Ruse [1986] 1998, 253). Of course, even if Ruse is correct, this does not show that moral judgments are not objective, but it can make us think whether the objectivity of morality really has to be explained, as many philosophers assume. Ruse has also argued that an evolutionary account of morality suggests that there are no moral facts in the first place. Anything we want to explain about morality can be explained without mentioning moral facts, or so Ruse argues. If moral facts are explanatorily redundant, indeed, moral realists (those who believe there are mind-independent, objective facts about morality, as discussed in Chapter 1) need to say why we should still suppose that moral facts do exist. Interestingly, Ruse\u2019s methodological naturalism leads him to embrace a view that goes against the metaphysical naturalist position that moral facts exist. Relatedly, Sharon Street, for example, argues that evolutionary explanations of morality show that moral realism is probably false. The kind of moral realism that Street has in mind is the view that moral properties exist as objective features of the world (to wit, whether stealing is wrong is independent of whether anyone thinks or feels that stealing is wrong). Street starts with the premise that our moral judgments are influenced by evolutionary forces. This fact, Street claims, gives rise to a dilemma for moral realists concerning the relation of the evolutionary forces that influenced our moral judgments and the moral facts claimed to exist by moral realists. If there is no relation between the evolutionary forces and the moral facts, then it would be an astonishing coincidence if many of our moral judgments were true. In light of the coincidence, we have no reason to assume that our moral judgments are true\u2014an unpalatable conclusion for realists. Claiming that there is a relation, however, is empirically dubious, according to Street. Mirroring Ruse\u2019s claim, moral facts could be purged from what we assume to exist because they do not perform an important explanatory function. So, we should reject moral realism. Street\u2019s argument illustrates how evolutionary theory can be used to make a case about which metaethical theories we should adopt. Both Ruse\u2019s and Street\u2019s arguments rely on the idea that we should only accept that something exists if it plays an indispensable explanatory role and there are means to resist these arguments. [12] Both arguments, as presented here, rely on the correctness of the evolutionary explanation of morality they convey. In the next section, we turn to the relevance of evolutionary ethics for moral epistemology. E.g. Enoch (2010) Can We have Justified Moral Beliefs? The evolutionary argument by Sharon Street can also be interpreted as an argument about moral justification and moral knowledge. Suppose that moral realists assume that there is no relation between our moral judgments and the moral facts. It would seem like an incredible coincidence if the realists were right that our moral judgments are nonetheless true. There are just too many possible moral truths and too many ways in which evolution could have \u201cpushed\u201d our moral beliefs. Street claims that such a coincidence would be too much to believe. But what is the problem, exactly, with having beliefs that are only coincidentally true? Depending on how we understand \u201ccoincidence,\u201d my belief that there is a bird outside my window is coincidentally true because had I looked a little later, the bird would have flown away already. Accidentally true beliefs do not seem problematic in every case. The question for proponents of Street\u2019s argument is to show why the evolutionary influence on human moral beliefs makes for a particularly problematic case of coincidence. The philosopher Richard Joyce argues that the problem has to do with the sensitivity of our moral beliefs to the moral facts (Joyce 2006). Given that our moral beliefs are influenced by evolutionary forces, and not by the moral facts, our moral beliefs would be the same even if the moral facts would change. But because we should not hold on to such insensitive beliefs, evolutionary explanations of morality show that our moral beliefs are unjustified (because they are not sensitive). It is not clear, however, whether and why evolutionary explanations of morality reveal something about our moral beliefs that is particularly troubling from an epistemological perspective. The impact of evolutionary ethics on epistemological questions depends on these deeper questions about epistemology. [13] Evolutionary explanations of morality, however, provide us with a useful starting point for thinking about these questions. See Klenk (2019). CONCLUSION Evolutionary ethics has helped us to get a much clearer sense of where the human moral sense is coming from. While this is a far cry from revealing to us what we ought to do, the research program seems full of promise nonetheless. Once we get into the details, we can see that it also raises deep theoretical questions about evolutionary explanations, the relation of descriptive and normative claims, the epistemology of justification and truth, and the general viability of naturalism in ethics. Much left to wonder, then, but with some ideas about where to get our answers.", "human1": "A survey of evolutionary ethics presents arguments by philosophers including Michael Ruse and Sharon Street about whether objective moral facts about right and wrong exist, or whether what we view as moral is dictated by evolutionary forces which have shaped our genes."}, "GUM_textbook_governments": {"fulltext": "1.1 What is Government? DIFFERENT TYPES OF GOVERNMENT The government of the United States can best be described as a republic, or representative democracy. A democracy is a government in which political power\u2014influence over institutions, leaders, and policies\u2014rests in the hands of the people. In a representative democracy, however, the citizens do not govern directly. Instead, they elect representatives to make decisions and pass laws on behalf of all the people. Thus, U.S. citizens vote for members of Congress, the president and vice president, members of state legislatures, governors, mayors, and members of town councils and school boards to act on their behalf. Most representative governments favor majority rule: the opinions of the majority of the people have more influence with government than those of the minority. If the number of elected representatives who favor a proposed law is greater than those who oppose it, the law will be enacted. However, in representative governments like the United States, minority rights are protected: people cannot be deprived of certain rights even if an overwhelming number of people think that they should be. For example, let\u2019s say American society decided that atheists, people who do not believe that God exists, were evil and should be imprisoned or expelled from the country. Even though atheists only account for about 7 percent of the population, they would be protected due to minority rights. 4 Even though the number of Americans who believe in God far outweighs the number who do not, the minority is still protected. Because decisions are made through majority rule, making your opinions known and voting for those men and women who make decisions that affect all of us are critical and influential forms of civic engagement in a representative democracy such as the United States. In a direct democracy, unlike representative democracy, people participate directly in making government decisions. For example, in ancient Athens, the most famous example of a direct democracy, all male citizens were allowed to attend meetings of the Assembly. Here they debated and voted for or against all proposed laws. Although neither the federal government nor any of the state governments function as a direct democracy\u2014the Constitution requires the national and state governments to be representative forms of government\u2014some elements of direct democracy do exist in the United States. While residents of the different states vote for people to represent them and to make laws in their behalf in the state legislatures and in Congress, people may still directly vote on certain issues. For example, a referendum or proposed law might be placed on the ballot for citizens to vote on directly during state or local elections instead of leaving the matter in the hands of the state legislature. At New England town meetings, all residents are allowed to debate decisions affecting the town (Figure 1.5). Such occasions provide additional opportunities for civic engagement. Figure 1.5 Residents of Boxborough, Massachusetts, gather in a local hotel to discuss issues affecting their town. New England town meetings provide an opportunity for people to experience direct democracy. This tradition has lasted for hundreds of years. (credit: modification of work by Liz West) Most countries now have some form of representative government (Figure 1.6). 5 At the other end of the political spectrum are elite-driven forms of government. In a monarchy, one ruler, usually a hereditary ruler, holds political power. Although the power of some monarchs is limited by law, and such kings and queens often rule along with an elected legislature that makes laws for the country, this is not always the case. Many southwest Asian kingdoms, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, have absolute monarchs whose power is unrestricted. As discussed earlier, another nondemocratic form of government is oligarchy, in which a handful of elite members of society, often those who belong to a particular political party, hold all political power. For example, in Cuba, as in China, only members of the Communist Party are allowed to vote or hold public office, and the party\u2019s most important members make all government decisions. Some nondemocratic societies are totalitarian in nature. Under totalitarianism, the government is more important than the citizens, and it controls all aspects of citizens\u2019 lives. Citizens\u2019 rights are limited, and the government does not allow political criticism or opposition. These forms of government are fairly rare. North Korea is an example of a totalitarian government. Figure 1.6 The map of the world shows the different forms of government that currently exist. Countries that are colored blue have some form of representative democracy, although the people may not have as much political power as they do in the United States. Countries that are colored red, like China, Vietnam, and Cuba, have an oligarchic form of government. Countries that are colored yellow are monarchies where the people play little part in governing.

What is resilience and grit? How can I apply the Uses and Gratification Theory to make decisions about my learning? How do I prevent negative bias from hindering learning? In this section, you will continue to increase your ability as an informed learner. Here you will explore how much of an influence motivation has on learning, as well as how to use motivation to purposefully take an active role in any learning activity. Rather than passively attempting to absorb new information, you will learn how to make conscious decisions about the methods of learning you will use (based on what you intend to do with the information), how you will select and use learning materials that are appropriate for your needs, and how persistent you will be in the learning activity. There are three main motivation concepts that have been found to directly relate to learning. Each of these has been proven to mean the difference between success and failure. You will find that each of these is a strong tool that will enable you to engage with learning material in a way that not only suits your needs, but also gives you ownership over your own learning processes. Resilience and Grit While much of this chapter will cover very specific aspects about the act of learning, in this section, we will present different information that may at first seem unrelated. Some people would consider it more of a personal outlook than a learning practice, and yet it has a significant influence on the ability to learn. What we are talking about here is called grit or resilience. Grit can be defined as personal perseverance toward a task or goal. In learning, it can be thought of as a trait that drives a person to keep trying until they succeed. It is not tied to talent or ability, but is simply a tendency to not give up until something is finished or accomplished. Figure 2.3 U.S. Army veteran and captain of the U.S. Invictus team, Will Reynolds, races to the finish line. (Credit: DoD News / Flickr / Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC-BY 2.0)) The study showed that grit and perseverance were better predictors of academic success and achievement than talent or IQ. This personality trait was defined as \u201cgrit\u201d by the psychologist Angela Duckworth. 1 In a 2007 study Duckworth and colleagues found that individuals with high grit were able to maintain motivation in learning tasks despite failures. The study examined a cross section of learning environments, such as GPA scores in Ivy League universities, dropout rates at West Point, rankings in the National Spelling Bee, and general educational attainment for adults. What the results showed was that grit and perseverance were better predictors of academic success and achievement than talent or IQ. Duckworth, A. L.; Peterson, C.; Matthews, M. D.; Kelly, D. R. (June 2007). \"Grit: Perseverance and passion for long-term goals\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 92 (6): 1087\u20131101. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1087. PMID 17547490. Applying Grit The concept of grit is an easy one to dismiss as something taken for granted. In our culture, we have a number of sayings and aphorisms that capture the essence of grit: \u201cIf at first you do not succeed, try, try again,\u201d or the famous quote by Thomas Edison: \u201cGenius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.\u201d The problem is we all understand the concept, but actually applying it takes work. If the task we are trying to complete is a difficult one, it can take a lot of work. The first step in applying grit is to adopt an attitude that looks directly to the end goal as the only acceptable outcome. With this attitude comes an acceptance that you may not succeed on the first attempt \u2014 or the nineteenth attempt. Failed attempts are viewed as merely part of the process and seen as a very useful way to gain knowledge that moves you toward success. An example of this would be studying for an exam. In your first attempt at studying you simply reread the chapters of your textbook covered in the exam. You find that while this reinforces some of the knowledge you have gained, it does not ensure you have all the information you will need to do well on the test. You know that if you simply read the chapters yet again, there is no guarantee you are going to be any more successful. You determine that you need to find a different approach. In other words, your first attempt was not a complete failure, but it did not achieve the end goal, so you try again with a different method. On your second try, you copy down all of the main points onto a piece of paper using the section headlines from the chapters. After a short break you come back to your list and write down a summary of what you know about each item on your list. This accomplishes two things: first, you are able to immediately spot areas where you need to learn more, and second, you can check your summaries against the text to make certain what you know is correct and adequate. In this example, while you may not have yet achieved complete success, you will have learned what you need to do next. In true grit fashion, for your next try, you study those items on your list where you found you needed a bit more information, and then you go through your list again. This time you are able to write down summaries of all the important points, and you are confident you have the knowledge you need to do well on the exam. After this, you still do not stop, but instead you change your approach to use other methods that keep what you have learned fresh in your mind.", "human1": "This section explains how studies have shown the benefits of grit and resilience in successful learning and gives an example of applying grit in studying for an exam over multiple attempts."}, "GUM_textbook_history": {"fulltext": "1 The Americas, Europe, and Africa Before 1492 1.1 The Americas Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Locate on a map the major American civilizations before the arrival of the Spanish Discuss the cultural achievements of these civilizations Discuss the differences and similarities between lifestyles, religious practices, and customs among the native peoples Figure 1.2 (credit: modification of work by Architect of the Capitol) Some scholars believe that between nine and fifteen thousand years ago, a land bridge existed between Asia and North America that we now call Beringia. The first inhabitants of what would be named the Americas migrated across this bridge in search of food. When the glaciers melted, water engulfed Beringia, and the Bering Strait was formed. Later settlers came by boat across the narrow strait. (The fact that Asians and American Indians share genetic markers on a Y chromosome lends credibility to this migration theory.) Continually moving southward, the settlers eventually populated both North and South America, creating unique cultures that ranged from the highly complex and urban Aztec civilization in what is now Mexico City to the woodland tribes of eastern North America. Recent research along the west coast of South America suggests that migrant populations may have traveled down this coast by water as well as by land. Researchers believe that about ten thousand years ago, humans also began the domestication of plants and animals, adding agriculture as a means of sustenance to hunting and gathering techniques. With this agricultural revolution, and the more abundant and reliable food supplies it brought, populations grew and people were able to develop a more settled way of life, building permanent settlements. Nowhere in the Americas was this more obvious than in Mesoamerica (Figure 1.3). Figure 1.3 This map shows the extent of the major civilizations of the Western Hemisphere. In South America, early civilizations developed along the coast because the high Andes and the inhospitable Amazon Basin made the interior of the continent less favorable for settlement. THE FIRST AMERICANS: THE OLMEC Mesoamerica is the geographic area stretching from north of Panama up to the desert of central Mexico. Although marked by great topographic, linguistic, and cultural diversity, this region cradled a number of civilizations with similar characteristics. Mesoamericans were polytheistic; their gods possessed both male and female traits and demanded blood sacrifices of enemies taken in battle or ritual bloodletting. Corn, or maize, domesticated by 5000 BCE, formed the basis of their diet. They developed a mathematical system, built huge edifices, and devised a calendar that accurately predicted eclipses and solstices and that priest-astronomers used to direct the planting and harvesting of crops. Most important for our knowledge of these peoples, they created the only known written language in the Western Hemisphere; researchers have made much progress in interpreting the inscriptions on their temples and pyramids. Though the area had no overarching political structure, trade over long distances helped diffuse culture. Weapons made of obsidian, jewelry crafted from jade, feathers woven into clothing and ornaments, and cacao beans that were whipped into a chocolate drink formed the basis of commerce. The mother of Mesoamerican cultures was the Olmec civilization. Flourishing along the hot Gulf Coast of Mexico from about 1200 to about 400 BCE, the Olmec produced a number of major works of art, architecture, pottery, and sculpture. Most recognizable are their giant head sculptures (Figure 1.4) and the pyramid in La Venta. The Olmec built aqueducts to transport water into their cities and irrigate their fields. They grew maize, squash, beans, and tomatoes. They also bred small domesticated dogs which, along with fish, provided their protein. Although no one knows what happened to the Olmec after about 400 BCE, in part because the jungle reclaimed many of their cities, their culture was the base upon which the Maya and the Aztec built. It was the Olmec who worshipped a rain god, a maize god, and the feathered serpent so important in the future pantheons of the Aztecs (who called him Quetzalcoatl) and the Maya (to whom he was Kukulkan). The Olmec also developed a system of trade throughout Mesoamerica, giving rise to an elite class. Figure 1.4 The Olmec carved heads from giant boulders that ranged from four to eleven feet in height and could weigh up to fifty tons. All these figures have flat noses, slightly crossed eyes, and large lips. These physical features can be seen today in some of the peoples indigenous to the area. THE MAYA After the decline of the Olmec, a city rose in the fertile central highlands of Mesoamerica. One of the largest population centers in pre-Columbian America and home to more than 100,000 people at its height in about 500 CE, Teotihuacan was located about thirty miles northeast of modern Mexico City. The ethnicity of this settlement\u2019s inhabitants is debated; some scholars believe it was a multiethnic city. Large-scale agriculture and the resultant abundance of food allowed time for people to develop special trades and skills other than farming. Builders constructed over twenty-two hundred apartment compounds for multiple families, as well as more than a hundred temples. Among these were the Pyramid of the Sun (which is two hundred feet high) and the Pyramid of the Moon (one hundred and fifty feet high). Near the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, graves have been uncovered that suggest humans were sacrificed for religious purposes. The city was also the center for trade, which extended to settlements on Mesoamerica\u2019s Gulf Coast. The Maya were one Mesoamerican culture that had strong ties to Teotihuacan. The Maya\u2019s architectural and mathematical contributions were significant. Flourishing from roughly 2000 BCE to 900 CE in what is now Mexico, Belize, Honduras, and Guatemala, the Maya perfected the calendar and written language the Olmec had begun. They devised a written mathematical system to record crop yields and the size of the population, and to assist in trade. Surrounded by farms relying on primitive agriculture, they built the city-states of Copan, Tikal, and Chichen Itza along their major trade routes, as well as temples, statues of gods, pyramids, and astronomical observatories (Figure 1.5). However, because of poor soil and a drought that lasted nearly two centuries, their civilization declined by about 900 CE and they abandoned their large population centers. Figure 1.5 El Castillo, located at Chichen Itza in the eastern Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, served as a temple for the god Kukulkan. Each side contains ninety-one steps to the top. When counting the top platform, the total number of stairs is three hundred and sixty-five, the number of days in a year. (credit: Ken Thomas) The Spanish found little organized resistance among the weakened Maya upon their arrival in the 1520s. However, they did find Mayan history, in the form of glyphs, or pictures representing words, recorded in folding books called codices (the singular is codex). In 1562, Bishop Diego de Landa, who feared the converted natives had reverted to their traditional religious practices, collected and burned every codex he could find. Today only a few survive.

In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons. First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not. Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its \u201ccore competency\u201d) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of his or her own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.", "human1": "This excerpt explains three reasons why specialization of labor increases production: it allows workers to specialize in work they have a talent for, it allows them to improve particularly in certain tasks, and it allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, such as by setting up assembly lines to lower production costs."}, "GUM_textbook_sociology": {"fulltext": "Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism Despite how much humans have in common, cultural differences are far more prevalent than cultural universals. For example, while all cultures have language, analysis of particular language structures and conversational etiquette reveal tremendous differences. In some Middle Eastern cultures, it is common to stand close to others in conversation. North Americans keep more distance and maintain a large \u201cpersonal space.\u201d Even something as simple as eating and drinking varies greatly from culture to culture. If your professor comes into an early morning class holding a mug of liquid, what do you assume she is drinking? In the United States, it\u2019s most likely filled with coffee, not Earl Grey tea, a favorite in England, or Yak Butter tea, a staple in Tibet. The way cuisines vary across cultures fascinates many people. Some travelers pride themselves on their willingness to try unfamiliar foods, like celebrated food writer Anthony Bourdain, while others return home expressing gratitude for their native culture\u2019s fare. Often, people in the United States express disgust at other cultures\u2019 cuisine and think that it\u2019s gross to eat meat from a dog or guinea pig, for example, while they don\u2019t question their own habit of eating cows or pigs. Such attitudes are an example of ethnocentrism, or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one\u2019s own cultural norms. Ethnocentrism, as sociologist William Graham Sumner (1906) described the term, involves a belief or attitude that one\u2019s own culture is better than all others. Almost everyone is a little bit ethnocentric. For example, Americans tend to say that people from England drive on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of the road, rather than on the \u201cother\u201d side. Someone from a country where dog meat is standard fare might find it off - putting to see a dog in a French restaurant \u2014 not on the menu, but as a pet and patron\u2019s companion. A good example of ethnocentrism is referring to parts of Asia as the \"Far East.\" One might question, \"Far east of where?\" A high level of appreciation for one\u2019s own culture can be healthy; a shared sense of community pride, for example, connects people in a society. But ethnocentrism can lead to disdain or dislike for other cultures and could cause misunderstanding and conflict. People with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to \u201chelp\u201d its people, because they see them as uneducated or backward-essentially inferior. In reality, these travelers are guilty of cultural imperialism, the deliberate imposition of one\u2019s own cultural values on another culture. Europe\u2019s colonial expansion, begun in the sixteenth century, was often accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism. European colonizers often viewed the people in the lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance, dress, religion, and other cultural practices. A more modern example of cultural imperialism may include the work of international aid agencies who introduce agricultural methods and plant species from developed countries while overlooking indigenous varieties and agricultural approaches that are better suited to the particular region. Ethnocentrism can be so strong that when confronted with all of the differences of a new culture, one may experience disorientation and frustration. In sociology, we call this culture shock. A traveler from Chicago might find the nightly silence of rural Montana unsettling, not peaceful. An exchange student from China might be annoyed by the constant interruptions in class as other students ask questions\u2014a practice that is considered rude in China. Perhaps the Chicago traveler was initially captivated with Montana\u2019s quiet beauty and the Chinese student was originally excited to see a U.S.-style classroom firsthand. But as they experience unanticipated differences from their own culture, their excitement gives way to discomfort and doubts about how to behave appropriately in the new situation. Eventually, as people learn more about a culture, they recover from culture shock. Culture shock may appear because people aren\u2019t always expecting cultural differences. Anthropologist Ken Barger (1971) discovered this when he conducted a participatory observation in an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic. Originally from Indiana, Barger hesitated when invited to join a local snowshoe race. He knew he\u2019d never hold his own against these experts. Sure enough, he finished last, to his mortification. But the tribal members congratulated him, saying, \u201cYou really tried!\u201d In Barger\u2019s own culture, he had learned to value victory. To the Inuit people, winning was enjoyable, but their culture valued survival skills essential to their environment: how hard someone tried could mean the difference between life and death. Over the course of his stay, Barger participated in caribou hunts, learned how to take shelter in winter storms, and sometimes went days with little or no food to share among tribal members. Trying hard and working together, two nonmaterial values, were indeed much more important than winning. During his time with the Inuit tribe, Barger learned to engage in cultural relativism. Cultural relativism is the practice of assessing a culture by its own standards rather than viewing it through the lens of one\u2019s own culture. Practicing cultural relativism requires an open mind and a willingness to consider, and even adapt to, new values and norms. However, indiscriminately embracing everything about a new culture is not always possible. Even the most culturally relativist people from egalitarian societies\u2014ones in which women have political rights and control over their own bodies\u2014would question whether the widespread practice of female genital mutilation in countries such as Ethiopia and Sudan should be accepted as a part of cultural tradition. Sociologists attempting to engage in cultural relativism, then, may struggle to reconcile aspects of their own culture with aspects of a culture that they are studying. Sometimes when people attempt to rectify feelings of ethnocentrism and develop cultural relativism, they swing too far to the other end of the spectrum. Xenocentrism is the opposite of ethnocentrism, and refers to the belief that another culture is superior to one\u2019s own. (The Greek root word xeno, pronounced \u201cZEE-no,\u201d means \u201cstranger\u201d or \u201cforeign guest.\u201d) An exchange student who goes home after a semester abroad or a sociologist who returns from the field may find it difficult to associate with the values of their own culture after having experienced what they deem a more upright or nobler way of living.", "human1": "Using several examples, this text explains ethnocentrism (evaluating a culture based on one\u2019s own norms) and cultural relativism (assessing a culture by its own standards), and warns against ethnocentrism leading to disdain for other cultures or culture shock, or excessive relativism leading to accepting practices such as female genital mutilation."}, "GUM_textbook_spacetime": {"fulltext": "24.2 Spacetime and Gravity LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: Describe Einstein\u2019s view of gravity as the warping of spacetime in the presence of massive objects Understand that Newton\u2019s concept of the gravitational force between two massive objects and Einstein\u2019s concept of warped spacetime are different explanations for the same observed accelerations of one massive object in the presence of another massive object Is light actually bent from its straight-line path by the mass of Earth? How can light, which has no mass, be affected by gravity? Einstein preferred to think that it is space and time that are affected by the presence of a large mass; light beams, and everything else that travels through space and time, then find their paths affected. Light always follows the shortest path\u2014but that path may not always be straight. This idea is true for human travel on the curved surface of planet Earth, as well. Say you want to fly from Chicago to Rome. Since an airplane can\u2019t go through the solid body of the Earth, the shortest distance is not a straight line but the arc of a great circle. Linkages: Mass, Space, and Time To show what Einstein\u2019s insight really means, let\u2019s first consider how we locate an event in space and time. For example, imagine you have to describe to worried school officials the fire that broke out in your room when your roommate tried cooking shish kebabs in the fireplace. You explain that your dorm is at 6400 College Avenue, a street that runs in the left-right direction on a map of your town; you are on the fifth floor, which tells where you are in the up-down direction; and you are the sixth room back from the elevator, which tells where you are in the forward-backward direction. Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but was soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time. Any event in the universe, whether nearby or far away, can be pinpointed using the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time. Newton considered space and time to be completely independent, and that continued to be the accepted view until the beginning of the twentieth century. But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between space and time, and that only by considering the two together\u2014in what we call spacetime\u2014can we build up a correct picture of the physical world. We examine spacetime a bit more closely in the next subsection. The gist of Einstein\u2019s general theory is that the presence of matter curves or warps the fabric of spacetime. This curving of spacetime is identified with gravity. When something else\u2014a beam of light, an electron, or the starship Enterprise\u2014enters such a region of distorted spacetime, its path will be different from what it would have been in the absence of the matter. As American physicist John Wheeler summarized it: \u201cMatter tells spacetime how to curve; spacetime tells matter how to move.\u201d The amount of distortion in spacetime depends on the mass of material that is involved and on how concentrated and compact it is. Terrestrial objects, such as the book you are reading, have far too little mass to introduce any significant distortion. Newton\u2019s view of gravity is just fine for building bridges, skyscrapers, or amusement park rides. General relativity does, however, have some practical applications. The GPS (Global Positioning System) in every smartphone can tell you where you are within 5 to 10 meters only because the effects of general and special relativity on the GPS satellites in orbit around the Earth are taken into account. Unlike a book or your roommate, stars produce measurable distortions in spacetime. A white dwarf, with its stronger surface gravity, produces more distortion just above its surface than does a red giant with the same mass. So, you see, we are eventually going to talk about collapsing stars again, but not before discussing Einstein\u2019s ideas (and the evidence for them) in more detail. Spacetime Examples How can we understand the distortion of spacetime by the presence of some (significant) amount of mass? Let\u2019s try the following analogy. You may have seen maps of New York City that squeeze the full three dimensions of this towering metropolis onto a flat sheet of paper and still have enough information so tourists will not get lost. Let\u2019s do something similar with diagrams of spacetime. Figure 24.7, for example, shows the progress of a motorist driving east on a stretch of road in Kansas where the countryside is absolutely flat. Since our motorist is traveling only in the east-west direction and the terrain is flat, we can ignore the other two dimensions of space. The amount of time elapsed since he left home is shown on the y-axis, and the distance traveled eastward is shown on the x-axis. From A to B he drove at a uniform speed; unfortunately, it was too fast a uniform speed and a police car spotted him. From B to C he stopped to receive his ticket and made no progress through space, only through time. From C to D he drove more slowly because the police car was behind him. Figure 24.7 Spacetime Diagram. This diagram shows the progress of a motorist traveling east across the flat Kansas landscape. Distance traveled is plotted along the horizontal axis. The time elapsed since the motorist left the starting point is plotted along the vertical axis. Now let\u2019s try illustrating the distortions of spacetime in two dimensions. In this case, we will (in our imaginations) use a rubber sheet that can stretch or warp if we put objects on it. Let\u2019s imagine stretching our rubber sheet taut on four posts. To complete the analogy, we need something that normally travels in a straight line (as light does). Suppose we have an extremely intelligent ant\u2014a friend of the comic book superhero Ant-Man, perhaps\u2014that has been trained to walk in a straight line. We begin with just the rubber sheet and the ant, simulating empty space with no mass in it. We put the ant on one side of the sheet and it walks in a beautiful straight line over to the other side (Figure 24.8). We next put a small grain of sand on the rubber sheet. The sand does distort the sheet a tiny bit, but this is not a distortion that we or the ant can measure. If we send the ant so it goes close to, but not on top of, the sand grain, it has little trouble continuing to walk in a straight line. Now we grab something with a little more mass\u2014say, a small pebble. It bends or distorts the sheet just a bit around its position. If we send the ant into this region, it finds its path slightly altered by the distortion of the sheet. The distortion is not large, but if we follow the ant\u2019s path carefully, we notice it deviating slightly from a straight line. The effect gets more noticeable as we increase the mass of the object that we put on the sheet. Let\u2019s say we now use a massive paperweight. Such a heavy object distorts or warps the rubber sheet very effectively, putting a good sag in it. From our point of view, we can see that the sheet near the paperweight is no longer straight.", "human1": "This section of a textbooks explains Einstein's insight that gravity warps spacetime proportionally to the amount of mass, allowing the path of light to be distorted by the gravity of stars, similarly to how the path of an ant walking straight on a rubber sheet would be distorted by a heavy paperweight on that sheet."}, "GUM_textbook_stats": {"fulltext": "2.3 Measures of the Location of the Data The common measures of location are quartiles and percentiles. Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile, Q3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th percentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, you must order the data from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. Recall that a percent means one-hundredth. So, percentiles mean the data is divided into 100 sections. To score in the 90th percentile of an exam does not mean, necessarily, that you received 90 percent on a test. It means that 90 percent of test scores are the same as or less than your score and that 10 percent of the test scores are the same as or greater than your test score. Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75th percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220. Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90 percent of the test scores are less, and not the same or less, than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant. The median is a number that measures the center of the data. You can think of the median as the middle value, but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example, consider the following data: 1, 11.5, 6, 7.2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 6.8, 8.3, 2, 2, 10, 1 Ordered from smallest to largest: 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5 When a data set has an even number of data values, the median is equal to the average of the two middle values when the data are arranged in ascending order (least to greatest). When a data set has an odd number of data values, the median is equal to the middle value when the data are arranged in ascending order. Since there are 14 observations (an even number of data values), the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two. (6.8+7.2)/2=7 The median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven. Quartiles are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles, first find the median, or second, quartile. The first quartile, Q1, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile, Q3, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. To get the idea, consider the same data set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5 The data set has an even number of values (14 data values), so the median will be the average of the two middle values (the average of 6.8 and 7.2), which is calculated as (6.8+7.2)/2 and equals 7. So, the median, or second quartile (Q2), is 7. The first quartile is the median of the lower half of the data, so if we divide the data into seven values in the lower half and seven values in the upper half, we can see that we have an odd number of values in the lower half. Thus, the median of the lower half, or the first quartile (Q1) will be the middle value, or 2. Using the same procedure, we can see that the median of the upper half, or the third quartile (Q3) will be the middle value of the upper half, or 9. The quartiles are illustrated below: Figure 2.11 The interquartile range is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half, or the middle 50 percent of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile (Q3) and the first quartile (Q1) IQR The IQR for this data set is calculated as 9 minus 2, or 7. The IQR can help to determine potential outliers. A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than 1.5 \u00d7 IQR below the first quartile or more than 1.5 \u00d7 IQR above the third quartile. Potential outliers always require further investigation. NOTE A potential outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points. These special data points may be errors or some kind of abnormality, or they may be a key to understanding the data. Example 2.15 For the following 13 real estate prices, calculate the IQR and determine if any prices are potential outliers. Prices are in dollars. 389,950; 230,500; 158,000; 479,000; 639,000; 114,950; 5,500,000; 387,000; 659,000; 529,000; 575,000; 488,800; 1,095,000 Try It 2.15 For the 11 salaries, calculate the IQR and determine if any salaries are outliers. The following salaries are in dollars. $33,000; $64,500; $28,000; $54,000; $72,000; $68,500; $69,000; $42,000; $54,000; $120,000; $40,500 In the example above, you just saw the calculation of the median, first quartile, and third quartile. These three values are part of the five number summary. The other two values are the minimum value (or min) and the maximum value (or max). The five number summary is used to create a box plot.", "human1": "This section of a statistics textbook explains measures of location for data, such as the median, quartiles and percentiles, as well as the interquartile range (IQR), using examples and an exercise to compute measures for some salary data."}, "GUM_vlog_appearance": {"fulltext": "Good morning everybody, welcome back to another vlog. Today is Wednesday. I started out this vlog outside because I really wanted to sit outside in this like beautiful weather and talk to you while I was eating my snack, and like, I just finished filming a main channel video out there, but then my neighbor came outside and like, things got kind of awkward. I just feel awkward being like \"what's up guys, \"like, I don't know when my neighbors are out in their backyard. So I'm just gonna let them have their peace and quiet, but I just finished my snack. I have a lot to do today. But like I said. Oh yes, also hi, pimple patches galore, so many of them. Are these as distracting to you as they are for me? Sorry, hi, it's me now. My face is breaking out so badly. I mentioned it in the last vlog. I think it's hormonal. I don't know, like I washed my makeup brushes. I changed my pillowcases once to twice a week. I am like diligent, like vigilant even about my skincare routine. So I don't really know what's going on. I think it's hormonal, but anyways, this is just real life and I've really been struggling with my appearance lately. It's been a really sore spot for me. I \u2014 we're just jumping right into it, aren't we? I'm just being honest, like, I am not in a good place with the way I look. And I also think I put way too much emphasis on what I look like, and the fact that I'm putting this on the internet and that I, like, get like this for the internet, is huge for me, it's always been huge for me, but also it's really hard when I'm editing. I have a really hard time, like just grappling with my appearance at times, and that's a really toxic thing for your mental health. And so I'm trying to break out of that, and I don't know, maybe some of you are also dealing with the same thing and are struggling with, I don't know, I just feel ugly. I feel ugly all the time. And I know that's not the case and ugly is such a subjective word. And also I feel like it's a word meant to like, oppress people, particularly women, but I've just been having a hard time with the way I look. Like my face and my hair, my features, the amount of body hair I have in random places because of like my hormones, my weight especially. So it's just, it's been rough. And I think I'm zooming out right now in my head and realizing that it's been two, almost two years of this shit, and that I obviously need to be more gentle with myself and I think I'm in the process of doing that, and this week, particularly I've been moving my body a little bit more and it's been feeling really good. And also, I'm very proud to say that I have actually gone back to therapy, which is something that I haven't done since \u2014 I mean the last time I was in therapy, almost I was like 20. I'm 33. Your girl's got trauma like, it's way past due. I think in the past I have really put off therapy because I wasn't ready to like open old wounds. And it takes a lot sometimes when you're in therapy, like it takes a toll on you mentally. And so, I knew that things were gonna have to get unearthed and things were definitely gonna have to get worse before they got better. And I've only just started, but I'm already feeling really good in that I'm taking this step towards bettering myself and it makes me really happy. And you know, my therapist, like the very first thing she said was, you know, you doing this takes a lot of courage. It's like a lot of bravery involved to do something like this and to kind of want to better yourself and to take these steps for you and your mental health. And I was just like, wow, thanks. So I did bring that up, the whole thing I was talking about before in therapy, where I have a really hard time with my appearance. In fact, it becomes like an obsession and I obsess over little, every angle and thing. And it probably doesn't seem that way, by the way I feel myself, but it's always just something that's in here, do you know what I mean? Conversations for first thing in the morning what the heck, it's not even 11:00 a.m., but hi, just coming right out of the gate, just with what's fresh on my mind. I know you all appreciate when I have these talks and you know, just kind of like get real with you. And I mean, doesn't get much realer than this. So anyways, today I have quite a bit of filming to do. I just filmed my like portion of a main channel video that was outside, that was really fun. I think maybe in this video, this vlog, I'm just in the mood to talk, you know, I don't really have much to show. I'm not really doing anything this week other than like hunkering down and doing as much work as possible. I don't think, maybe in the next vlog I might do some fall things, excuse me. I'm really just kind of preparing to go out of town next week and I have like a lot of deadlines and stuff before then. So I don't, I kinda just wanna chat. But first -- Okay, I'm gonna try not -- I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm just being honest, I was just about to say we need to do something about this. I still feel that way, but I'm working on it.

So I've been planning to vlog today um because I was going to do like a little productive day of my life blah blah blah but then I literally had a mental breakdown at 4 am last night. And I was like, I can't vlog tomorrow because I'm just not gonna have the mental energy or the physical energy to do anything productive. Like I didn't even think I would be able to wake up for my 8:15 a.m. yoga class that I signed up for, but I am awake. So I was kind of like, maybe I should vlog today and just see how my day turns around because we're getting off on a rough start right now. But yeah, I will just take you guys through another day in my life. I'll take you guys to yoga with me and we'll just see if things improve. I have my glasses on now. Um today's Wednesday, it's quite gloomy out. Yeah, I have my usual co-op today. And then after that, I have my class, my marketing brand management class. And I have a meeting tonight. I'm gonna start getting ready for my yoga class soon so let's start doing that. I got this workout set from Amazon and it is so good. It's like really thick and stretchy and comfy and soft. This is my fit for the day. I guess I've come to the conclusion that if I wear more workout clothes, like just in my daily life, then I'll be more inclined to go to the gym because I don't have to like change OOTD haha. Alright, I'm pretty much all ready to go, I just need to like pack my bag because I am basically just not coming home. I'm going to Saxby's right after to just do all the work I need to do for the day, so yeah. Alright, I'm heading out. I'm actually very excited for this yoga class. I think it'll be good for me and it's gonna be relaxing. But, I'm running on a lot of coffee and very little sleep today. So eee wish me luck. Hey friends! Hi! We're done with yoga. She's nice. She gave me a foot massage. That one I was kind of like, whoa I'm being touched now. It was nice, though. Yeah! I usually don't like massages, but like, this was fine. But yeah, we're heading to Saxby's now to do work. I have a Starbucks bottle with me. I always get super insecure. They're probably looking at me and being like this bitch. I got Starbucks and went to United by Blue one day and I poured it into a different cup. Are you fucking kidding me? It's cheaper! Starbucks is cheaper than United by Blue? Yeah. That's just like a local cafe. The chai latte is better. I'm in a much better mood than I was this morning. I literally started the vlog and I was like, \"hey!\". And now we did yoga! So now we did yoga. Serotonin is coursing through my body and so is a lot of caffeine. My co-op hours start in like an hour and I'm just gonna be doing emails again and again. But that's okay. Good afternoon friends! I was a terrible vlogger today because I got home and just completely knocked so. Why is this avocado red? Like red how? Like literally red. Anyways now it's like 5:19 p.m. We're making dinner. As you can see, we're we're actively making dinner. And on today's vlog segment of cooking with Ash, Harry! Both wearing sorority sweatshirts. One of us needs to change. Well I got this from you and I put it on first. We're making pesto pasta with penne, roasted peppers, onion, garlic, and avocado. AKA every vegetarian thing that Ash has in her fridge that will remotely go well together. Gordon Ramsay could never with this technique. The one-handed type. The one-handed chop whatever. You know I've been cooking a lot more in my vlogs and I'm starting to think like, what if Gordon Ramsay is watching my vlogs and just absolutely shitting on me. Alright friends we're back, but now on Harry's phone because my phone died. Mhm. We we love a boyfriend that supports the YouTube hustle. Yes it's a I provide a service. Yeah, he doesn't watch my videos though. I like them. You you like my videos? Yeah I press the like button. Oh so you don't even like, emotionally like them. You just physically like them. Well I'm there for some of them so I like those. You only like the ones you're featured in? That's not what I \u2014 that's not what I said. That's what you implied. Are we having our first couple fight on the vlog? You're taking words out of my mouth. I just don't appreciate it. I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna call this vlog first couple fight, not click bait. Anyways we're going to chop these bad boys up. Do you want to use all three of them or just like one of them or? Why don't we just use a little bit from all three so we get some color in there? Yeah, let's make it colorful. Yeah. Sizzle! My parents are gonna be so proud of me that I'm cooking. Yeah. I hope so. Mom and dad if you're watching this, I'm making healthy food. Here comes the pasta. Yay dinner! It's delicious. Hi guys, I'm the worst and I forgot to do an outro for this. But yeah, that was just a little day in my life.

Welcome back to another video. For those of you who are new here and don't know me, my name is Jasmine, and I'm so glad you're here on my channel. If you haven't already followed my social media, I'll link it right here. My socials are @jasthenurse. So, if you haven't watched my other video, I wanted to give you guys an update as to my experience with Covid. For those of you who hadn't already watched that video, I'm gonna link that video right here so that you can watch it. Um, so essentially, on the 16th of December, I tested positive for Covid. If I'm sounding out of breath, my lingering shortness of breath, and then also you know that I always talk fast in these videos. In this video, I wanted to update you all regarding my symptoms of Covid and just my overall experience with it. For one, it can make people more aware and then hopefully make people feel a little bit less alone. So, my first symptom, which was on Monday, was a sore throat. And the thing is, on Sunday night, I had gotten back from work around 9:00 pm, so I took a shower. Um I never really dried my hair, which is so awful, but I decided to go straight to bed because I was so exhausted. I just wanted to go to sleep. But I went to bed with my hair wet. And you know like when you wake up sometimes you have like a sore throat because of the fact that your hair was wet and you were cold? So, I assumed oh that like maybe it was just like a sore throat gotten because I didn't bother to you know blow dry my hair. So, that happened. Um what about my day Tuesday? My sister tests positive. So, you know like I go oh shit like I've been hanging out in the car with her. Even though I was wearing a mask, she wasn't wearing a mask, and she was like obviously coughing um. And so that prolonged period of time, we were probably in the car with each other for like 40 minutes because we drove one way and then drove back. That 40 minutes, her coffee in the car, the \u2013 all the windows closed, and even though I had a mask on, the virus circulates. That Tuesday, I remember I had been getting a little bit more symptomatic. My sore throat didn't go away, um very very mild symptoms. I \u2013 all the clinics were closed by the time that she had gotten her results which was around like 6:00 pm. I had booked an appointment or an e-visit with my um insurance to get me tested the next day. I get tested on Wednesday, and when I'm tested on Wednesday, I remember that night, um I believe that was the day where I had actually gotten a fever and chills. So, at night I was getting really hot then cold then hot and cold. And I remember at one point I checked my temperature's only like 98.7, but at another point it was like 101 or something really high that was obviously a fever. And then around day four, everything started to like stabilize. Five, it was like really nothing. Um day six was when I noticed like the my sinuses were feeling weird. It was no longer a headache anymore. It was more like my like congestion like right up here, it was like a weird. Know when it \u2013 you can't like sneeze? That's what the feeling was. It felt like like like there was a sneeze drop in there, and I couldn't get it out. Um so, day six and seven, I started noticing that my taste buds started to change. Oh, let me mention, um nearly day two or three, my senses were like really really heightened. I don't know if you remember the clip of when I had been eating those chips. Chips taste so strong to me. I guess that's like what happens when you lose your taste buds, I don't know, olfactory nerves, I don't know. So, from there, I had gotten um a complete 180 and went from everything being like really heightened sense of taste and even the smell, because I remember I was gargling apple cider vinegar, and I remember smelling it from across the room, and now I can't really. Well, I would say that I have like 30 percent of my taste and smell. So, for example, if you can see my Bath and Body Works candle, I try to smell that every morning to see if my change in smell changes, and I have like maybe 30 percent of my like smelling capabilities. I have to get like this close to be able to smell the candle, which is insane because those candles are so strong, you literally open one up and you can smell it all over your room. I can still smell, but not to my like fullest capability. I don't know if you guys have seen those like TikToks where people try and drink different things like pickle juice and water and Gatorade. First of all, that's like super inaccurate. When you drink, you can still, for example, I took like a ginger shot this morning, and it had cayenne pepper. I can still that feel that burning sensation. So, for example, I tested if I could drink alcohol, and I drank a Truly, and I can still taste the alcohol like burning sensation going down. So, you can kind of distinguish if it's like sweet or salty or tart um, but you can't really taste it to its fullest if that makes any sense. Like like for example, I made mac and cheese, I don't know if you saw earlier. I don't really know exactly how it tastes because I can only like I can kind of taste the cheese, um the saltiness, but it's more so um I'm able to feel the textures.", "human1": "Jasmine tells about how she tested positive for Covid on December 16th after she spent time without a mask with her sister, who also tested positive, and recounts her symptoms over several days, starting from a sore throat, then fever and congestion, and finally a partial loss of smell and taste and shortness of breath."}, "GUM_vlog_exams": {"fulltext": "Neuroscience finals. Hi! Good morning, it is Monday May 3rd 10:38 a.m. I have a meeting at 10:45 so in a few minutes with one of my TFs about my project. I'm gonna meet with her quickly and see if she has any feedback and then I'll be working on chem and neuro. She's not here yet. Hi! I'm so sorry, I went to the section link. I was waiting there, I was like \"uhm, did I get the time wrong?\" But okay, this makes a lot more sense. My hair is in a bun. I took a shower. I should let it dry but I'm too lazy to take it out. It's a new day, a little rainy outside. But I actually like when it's gloomy for studying because then I feel like there's nothing else you could be doing, so you might as well just stay inside and work. So I have some coffee and I'll be focusing entirely on chem and neuro today, I think. Full day of studying, not really much to update you all on. Hello! It is 2:25 a.m. I've just been studying for neuroscience, my neuro exam. It's currently 2:25 a.m. on Wednesday. It's raining. I've been doing a semi - Pomodoro technique but I've been doing like working from like half an hour to an hour and then taking like 10 minute breaks. I do it based off of what I'm trying to get done because I have my neuroscience final study schedule. These are the things I've gotten done, so I got this done, this done, this done. I'm currently working on this and then I'll try to get to this, but if I can't then I can do it tomorrow. Just wanted to show you. This is realistic. I'm up very late so I wanted to show that, finals as a college student, you know. So I'm going to do what I can and then maybe finish like one or two more lectures and then I will start taking a look at chem. I will be up for a little while longer. Hi Kat! A lot of the notes that I had taken from our last meeting and being more of a cause or like leading to memory's importance for each of the sources, I \u2014 I essentially changed it to um \"it's the one persistent element of our existence that gives meaning to the inheritance of memory\". How do we remember? I asked this not only as a question of the methods, but also of the circumstances. Oh my god, I'm so tired. I accidentally posted a video I meant to schedule. So now I have to post about it. I like deleted Instagram and like wasn't really checking social media too much this week, but now I have to redownload it, so I can post about it. Finals! Hello! It is May 7th Friday May 7th the day of my final, currently 9:46 a.m. I'm going to be taking it at 10 a.m., so I have 15 minutes. The reason I'm taking it like this early is because I have my med school class at two to four thirty, so we have three hours 45 minutes to take it. I'm gonna take it at ten, so I can finish around like 1:45 in time for my class. I'm nervous. I'm really nervous. I don't feel too great about it, but I'm going to be kind to myself with this. It was a really weird tiring semester, I think, relatively, compared to last semester, so you know, it is what it is. I'll try my best and am just gonna take the test, move on, it's just one more test. Wish me luck! Hello! Hi! How are you? Watching BTS. That's lovely. Hi guys! I finished my neuroscience exam a little bit after noon. It is now two o'clock and today is my friend Megumi's birthday. If you know Megumi then you'll know that she is one of my best friends. She also surprised me on my birthday, so now it's my turn. I'm going to be ordering some donuts to pick up and then head over to her house and surprise her. Let's see. Honey - glazed. Okay, perfect.

So welcome back to my channel. So it's Shawntas Way here today, and today I'm going to be talking to you guys about number one: my new product line. I have new products out, and I'm gonna be showing you guys today exactly how I'm going to be using my products, and I'm also going to be showing you guys this extreme moisture bomb routine that you can do, um, for wintertime because it is getting a little bit colder outside. Um, which you always want to focus on the moisture of your hair, but the colder months in some areas of the world can be brutal. Um, it's not like super cold w- where I am just yet, but it's getting there, so ignore my hair right now. I know it looks kinda crazy. I just now got done washing it. I'm gonna tell you guys about that process as well, but first let's go ahead and get into these products! I cannot believe that I'm actually showing you guys these products. So this product line is the Angelic Coco line, and I have been working on this line since 2019. Um, as you guys see there's only two products, but of course I'm going to be expanding. Um, and you guys will see, like, a lot more stuff in the future, but first we want to focus on these two products. I wanted to get these out to you guys because you guys have been asking for styling products since the beginning, so I'm so glad to finally have actual styling products that I can, um, you know, present to you guys. So this first product that I'm going to show you guys is the Nourished by Shawnta Curl Defining and Soft Hold Styler, which is enriched with sesame seed oil and rose essence. So it's the Angelic Coco Curl Creator Cream, and it has coconut plus rose in it. So this product is \u2013 I just \u2013 I love it. It's so moisturizing. It's really really thick. You guys can see on the camera it's super thick. Um, it does have like a butter feel to it. It's a cream, but it has a really buttery feel to it. And it's of course white, hence the name \"Angelic Coco\". The ingredients in here are super jam-packed. There's even honey in here. I wanted to make sure that this styler actually contributes to the health of your hair. So a lot of times with stylers, they're just, you know, there to give you a nice style, which is great, but I want to make sure that all my products are geared towards the health of the hair even if they're styling products. So I was, like, not backing down on that part. So there are, like, really jam-packed vitamins, nutrients in this formula. As I mentioned, one of the ingredients is pure honey, along with a lot more nutrient-dense botanicals and herbs. There's even horsetail in here, which is amazing for hair growth. So this is geared towards moisturizing your hair and also hair growth. As you guys know, that's all I talk about on my channel most of the time. I really did want to make sure that I infused that into the product as well. If you guys are wondering, the smell of this product is very natural. It's very natural, and it doesn't have a strong scent. With all of my products are normally like a pretty natural smell. I don't put really really strong scents in my products. I can just like \u2013 I can't even begin to tell you how much time and effort I put into this line. And, um, I'm just super excited. I just \u2013 I don't know what to say. I'm like \"What else can I say? What else can I say?\" I don't know what to say. I'm just so excited to finally, like, give it to you guys and know that it's gonna contribute to the actual health of your hair. You can use this on twist outs. You can use this on braid outs. You can even use it on your wash-n-go as well. But I will say with wash-n-go's a- on my channel, I always show you guys wash-n-go's where I put a gel on there. So I could not come out with a cream and tell you guys just \u2013 \"You can use it on your wash-n-go's\" when that would kinda go against all that I've always said on my channel, which is \"Gels actually are what make your wash-n-go stay.\" So that brings us to the next product, which is my curl defining jelly. I have a gel as well, so it's not just a cream. I have another styler as well, which is a gel. So the next product is the Angelic Clear Coarse Jelly with aloe plus rosemary, and it's a curl-defining and light-to-medium whole jelly, and it's enriched with aloe vera juice, which is amazing. Amazing for hair moisture. So with gels \u2013 a lot of times you will find gels that kinda, like, dry out your hair. Lots of ingredients in it that kinda like counteracts what you would typically want for your hair. But a lot of times we kinda, like, deal with it because, you know, the gel is what's gonna keep our hair in place and make it actually last. So I wanted to make a gel that did not do any of those things. So this gel is going to give a light-to-medium health. You guys already know that \u2013 if you follow my channel for a while, you know that I use, like, light defining gels and jellies and stuff all throughout my channel. Um, and more of the harder gels that really, like, make your hair feel super hard \u2013 I don't normally use those because I don't feel like you need all that. You just need, like, a nice holding gel.", "human1": "On her channel, Shawnta's Way, Shawnta presents her new Nourished by Shawnta Curl Defining and Soft Hold Styler, which is a buttery hair cream with sesame seed oil, rose essence, coconut, honey and horsetail, and her Angelic Clear Coarse Jelly, a hair gel with aloe and rosemary."}, "GUM_vlog_hiking": {"fulltext": "Good morning!

And on our last day we were like \"we're sleeping in\". So we slept to like 7:15 today. Anyways I just wanted to show you guys this is what our shoes look like every day after we get done hiking in Glacier. They're super super super dusty. That's how the paths are, so I have to clean them every day um but yeah. So that's fun just a heads up, hiking in Glacier, it's not muddy it's just the dusty dirt paths are very dusty. They are all cleaned up! But hey I just wanted to give a shout out to these Adidas Terrex shoes, I literally bought these hiking shoes right before our trip. They literally arrived on my doorstep the day before we left for the trip because I needed some new hiking shoes, and these have been absolutely the best hiking shoes I've ever owned. So if you're in a need for some new hiking shoes I definitely recommend these Adidas Terrex. What I like about these is that they're tennis shoe-like then they have the rubber soles on the front for if you're walking through, like, wet grass areas and the grip on these guys are amazing. So these have been awesome for hiking and I highly recommend them, especially if you're looking for like a lighter shoe that's not heavy like hiking boots or anything. These have been great. If you need shoes, get these. So it's our last day and we are just driving the uh \u2013 Going to the Sun Road and we\u2019re just gonna stop along wherever we want to go. We're not having any plans today and right now we are at like a river waterfall area, so yeah we're just gonna kind of roll with whatever happens today, so just chill, relax and enjoy our last day in beautiful Glacier National Park! Alright so I think we're gonna just do a tiny bit of hiking this morning just to kind of get out and move, and we feel pretty good from hiking 12 miles yesterday, like we're totally ready to go again. So that's good! So I think we're gonna start here at the loop trailhead which is the same highline \u2013 um, trail that we did the other day. It's just the other end of it, um, so we're just gonna hike a little bit on that. It is overcast today and they said there could be some rain, so we're probably gonna go far and that's okay. We really want to just chill out today so um we're just gonna hike and see what happens. This is a pretty cool little thing that is posted here at the loop so this Going-To-The-Sun Road is actually considered a national landmark now, how cool. 1997 they declared it. That's so cool. It's one of the best roads in the US I feel, it's amazing. Alright here it is. Ready to do a little hiking? Sure. Alright. Morning! And we\u2019re in grizzly bear country! We got the bear spray though. Alright, I think we made it about a mile on the loop and I think we're gonna turn around because thing is it's all uphi- uphill and we're just we're being lazy today. We've been hiking 10 plus miles a day so, you know what, last day we're gonna \u2013 we're gonna chill. And yeah I'm gonna head back and then just keep driving and stop along the way. Just driving on the Sun Road, probably go to Saint Mary's Lake again. Just kind of getting in the last views of this beautiful road. So yeah, so pretty. It's just a really big like traffic jam here on the road. There's a grizzly bear and two babies that were hanging out up here. I couldn't get it on my camera. She was like too far away and then she'd like go into the bush and stuff but I do have my big Canon and I was able to get some photos of her but that was cool! We finally seen grizzly bears! Finally! Because we haven't seen any yet and it's our last day so we were really hoping to see some today and we did! So whoo-hoo! Glad it was mama and babies, so cute, and far away. Far away, not on the trail. She was huge! She was a big big big mama. So that's so cool I'm so glad we found. So, cheers! Guys so we had an awesome lazy day in the park today and now we are ending our time in Glacier with some pizza. We got beers at Pizza Hut in Montana! Montana, you can get beer. Whoa mind blowing It's not even \u2013 it's not three - two, it's like real good. It's real beer, not three two, yes. It's the real deal Alright Pizza Hut was awesome and now we went and got some ice cream. We're so healthy. We\u2019re the healthiest. I told him a small. Everything's bigger in Montana. Everything's bigger in Montana. It\u2019s huge. But anyways we're just down by this river here that's like right here in Columbia Falls and we're going to eat our ice cream and enjoy our last evening here. Cheers. In Montana. Yeah. Cheers! Alright you guys, it's our last day here and at Glacier National Park. It is windy as you can see I just wanted to thank you guys so much for watching our vlog.

It's like lipstick central. It's actually pretty crazy in here. Eventually I actually \u2014 maybe we can check for this at Target. I actually want to get one of those acrylic things where the lipsticks can just stand up in it and it looks super neat. Like that's definitely what I want. But I also need to clear a lot of these out because I know a lot of these lipsticks are at least over like two three years old and that's like not okay. Alright so let's have a quick look at this. My fancy lipsticks \u2014 I can't part with them yet. I just I literally can't so I'm gonna keep those. Let's see. Okay so this is a Pat McGrath lipstick. Oh my gosh. It's like the most beautiful red lipstick. Look at this. Let me swatch it for you real quick, real quick. Mm! Look at how beautiful this is. I feel like I don't want to throw it away. But anyways, so on the bottom of this lipstick you can see where it says eighteen months is the shelf life so. Let me see if I can \u2014 Can you all see this? I will definitely insert a little clip here that will show you what the shelf life symbol looks like on products. So you will find this on all your cosmetics, your makeup. It is usually on there. So when it says eighteen M that means that product, after eighteen months, is expired. I feel like this is not too far past eighteen months, and I mean look at the red. It's beautiful, so I can't part with it. This is a problem. Oh my gosh. The doorbell rang. Excitement! Who's at the door Hershey? Ah! Alright. I'll be right back. I got to get the door. Alright. Let's get back into the spring cleaning. You're gonna spring clean with me? What a sweet baby. Yes you are! Look at her. Guys I love her so much! Hershey it's your first vlog. You're doing great. Ah! Alright. Let's get into this. See what else we got here. Okay Too Faced Melted Matte Liquid Lipstick. I also love this. I love this color. See what this says. This says twelve months. One hundred percent this is definitely definitely expired, but it's just with lipsticks it's kind of hard to tell. Like \u2014 like usually with foundations when it's expired, you will see the oil separating and all that, but this just looks \u2014 it looks fine. Makes it hard to throw away, but I'm gonna create like a little expired pile down here on the floor. Alright what is this? Oh this is Ofra! Oh my god I had this back in college is when I ordered this, which is probably around twenty sixteen. This is four years old. Everything has like rubbed off of it. This has one thousand percent got to go in the throw away pile. Oh it looks kind of dry and crusty too. Yeah no. Not a good look. Let's throw this out. Go ahead and comment below. How many of you people actually knew that makeup expires? Cuz I actually did not know and actually didn't realize what that symbol meant until I heard other people talking about it and I was like wait what?. Next up we got Ashton Liquid Lipstick by Anastasia Beverly Hills. Six months! You're supposed to finish a whole liquid lipstick in six months. That is wild. I definitely had this for at least \u2014 at least four years cuz I definitely had this in college as well. Yeah that's gonna have to go in the expired pile. So Dose of Colors definitely does not have an expiration date on their products. I don't know if this means that they just don't expire or I don't know. I don't know what that means. Okay. Let's keep going. I'ma just put all the Dose of Color in a separate pile cuz that's kind of weird. I might need to research that a little bit. Oh! Okay. Let me show you guys. That is an expired lipstick. Ew. Okay so the fancy lipsticks have a shelf life of twelve months, so one full year. I know I've definitely had this over a year though. I think. Have I had this over a year? My gosh it's hard to think back. But yeah this just does not look good. That's gonna have to go in the expired pile. Yikes! This black is also not looking good. I feel like I've only had the black since last year Halloween though. Or was it the Halloween before? Guys this is harder than I thought. I can't remember when I bought things. It's not looking good though. It's all like super separated. I don't like how that looks. Expired! Oh so this is interesting. Black Up actually has twenty four months of shelf life for their lip pencils which is really really good. That's two years. But is that actually good? Does that mean that this is chocked full of preservatives? That's like not healthy for you? I don't know! But I've definitely had this for more than two years. Expired. This blue lipstick is definitely old. Definitely old. I don't know if you can actually tell by looking at it but she's old. Let's see what the shelf life is. That's interesting. The Urban Decay does not have a shelf life on the actual stick. So you know how lipsticks usually come in packaging? It usually comes in that little box? I'm thinking that maybe Dose of Colors and Urban Decay have the shelf life printed on those boxes but who keeps their lipsticks in a box? Like how do I know now if this is expired or not? I've definitely had this over two years though so I'm just gonna go ahead and throw it in the expired pile. I feel like two years is kind of the limit that I've seen so far. This has a shelf life of six months! Expired. So this is the throw out slash expired pile. This is the I don't know what to do with it pile, but I think these are all the Dose of Colors lipsticks that I know I've had for at least over two years.", "human1": "For spring cleaning, a vlogger goes over her old lipsticks in order to clear out expired ones, and decides to throw out her Too Faced Melted Matte Liquid, Ofra, Ashton Liquid and Urban Decay lipsticks, but not her favority red Pat McGrath lipstick, or the Dose of Color products which have no expiration date."}, "GUM_vlog_mermaid": {"fulltext": "Hey it\u2019s Jackie and welcome back to my vlog channel.

I really wanted to do something with pearls and do an updo and then have really bronzy makeup. And the tail, we have a silicone tail this time, is very similar to this lip tone, and my friend Marianne is staying with us and I love her photography style and styling.

And then after that we are headed to Orlando, I\u2019m gonna see my parents and we\u2019re doing Harry Potter World.

Oh my god it\u2019s so peaceful. We\u2019re in Florida. Oh such a beautiful aerosol. There\u2019d be no poison ivy, right? Yeah, maybe \u2026 I love how you have your, um \u2013 Okay! What just happened? Why are you not in \u2013 why are you not over there anymore? I ran for my life because I heard a little chirping sound and we already saw the gator warning, so I was like \u2013 and threw the tail off, probably good. Sorry I didn\u2019t get it on video. That sound! Where you going \u2013 where are you going? But yeah, we\u2019re packing up and we\u2019re headed to Orlando. Have anything to say? You look like you were about to. It\u2019s a very \u2013 it was a bird or something, some sort of small \u2013 It was not a bird, it was a crocodile. We made it! Oh no that\u2019s not going anywhere. Jump from one bed to the other, like a child. And we\u2019re doing Universal tomorrow. We are all so loopy but I think we are gonna watch a little bit of Harry Potter Good morning! This is the Harry Potter World outfit of the day. We did not get up as early as we should have. Wow, what are you doing? I booked the tickets for the wrong day and that was stressful, but I ended up getting them switched, and we finally made it. We\u2019re here! Wow! And welcome to Hogsmeade! For the best experience get a park to park ticket so you can do both Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley. This was my favorite area in the park, maybe because it wasn\u2019t as crowded yet and the wand shop is so epic. Everything is really detailed and when you look up even on the way going into the shop there are owls that move up high. You know I gotta go with the kid. But there\u2019s so many pretty ones! Marianne, which one are you going to get? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m looking at every single one! It\u2019s a big choice. So we got our wands from the shop, and apparently they\u2019re interactive. We don\u2019t actually know what we\u2019re doing, but here is my wand. Cheers! Cheers! Try it out! Oh yeah! Oh my gosh! Okay, we\u2019re trying. It\u2019s good, right? Yeah! This one\u2019s so pretty! Oh you made it move! Okay, how do you do it? I kind of \u2013 I do the same motion. Oh okay, thank you! Now we know. Look at this tea shop! Sorry! So we just went on at the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ride. You can see that Hogwarts right there. And it was so fun, like, I\u2019m not a rides person, but, um, it felt like you were flying. It was very magical. So, highly recommend going there. And the wait wasn\u2019t even that bad, so yeah. How did you like it? I loved it. I was a little scared. Oh that is so fun! How did you do that? With the park to park ticket we took the train to Diagon Alley and for lunch we went to the Leaky Cauldron, which has a bunch of British themed food. I would say the food is like a 5 out of 10.

My name is Katie and today I'm going to be talking about my two and a half week long vacation to Portland, Oregon. So I am from Washington D.C., and I have a bunch of family in Portland, Oregon, so it wasn't my first time going there. Um but it was definitely my first time, like as an adult. So that was really exciting and fun. I thought that I would make sort of like more of an informative video because I could just like post a vlog, but um the footage was like so random, and all over the place. I got some really cool footage but um, not like cute like Instagram girl footage, because I did dress like a 12 year old boy the whole time. So the first thing that I recommend you do in Portland is not actually in Portland at all. So you might be like this is a terrible list. Sorry. The number one thing that we did on our trip was we actually stayed a night in Eugene, Oregon, and we got up at like the crack of dawn and drove to Crater Lake. This was incredible. Um one of the coolest things that I have ever seen. The footage that I'm gonna put in here honestly it looks a little bit fake. This place was incredible. We didn't do a whole lot of hiking here because there was not a whole lot of cloud coverage that day, and it was so hot. So what we did was we drove around the entire perimeter of the lake and you get all these incredible views of the mountains and the lake, and seeing it from all the different angles was so worth it. So maybe this is not something that you want to do if you're just going to Portland for a couple of days but it's definitely something to consider if you're going out to Oregon for a little bit longer period of time. Number two is shopping. These are in no particular order by the way. They're just sort of like what I thought of as I was making this video. So there's a lot of cool shopping in Portland, Oregon. A lot of cool thrifting and vintage stores, a lot of cool art galleries. And then one of the biggest things that you should check out while you're there is Powell's which is a bookstore. And I want to say it's like the the biggest like Indie Indie bookstore in America. I guess that's what it's called. I'm gonna \u2013 oh, it's the world's largest independent bookstore. So this place was so cool we could have spent hours in here. The best thing that I thought about this bookstore was that they mixed in new copies of books with used copies. So if you're looking for a book and you're wondering like \u2013 oh I wonder if I could get this used, like it's usually right next to it, which I thought was just like so awesome. That was very exciting for me because I love a used book. So I am not a huge like nature person. Um I don't enjoy bugs. But um I will go on a good hike from now and again so just like you know where I'm coming from. My friend Andrea is a biology major so we did stop to look at many slugs that were on the ground and I did beeline it away from the slugs. But if you like slugs, you're in \u2013 you're in luck. So the first couple days we were in Portland, we went hiking in Forest Park which you can get to by public transit in the city. It's really quick and some of the trails even pop you back out into like the city, so it's \u2013 it's really super accessible. So we did the Wildwood Trail and we also did a tour of Pittock Mansion. Um if you don't want to do a tour of Pittock Mansion, I'd still recommend like taking the trail up there because it has a really cool like overlook of the city that you can go see. Um I loved doing that. So number four are the Japanese gardens and the rose gardens in Forest Park. I actually don't know if they're like technically in Forest Park but they're right in the same area. So the rose garden is free and open to the public and it is just huge. It's a lot of roses as you can imagine. Um lots of tourists but it was \u2013 it was still really fun. You get to walk through all these gardens and different types of roses from different parts of the world and yeah it was just really cool. Then the Japanese gardens you do have to pay for but I will say that it was definitely worth it. If it's a clear day you can actually see Mount Hood from the Japanese gardens which was really wild, and the garden was just so pretty and quiet and serene. There were even some people like meditating in there which was kind of funny. I did wear my bird shirt \u2013 It's a pretty good bird shirt, I got a compliment on it \u2013 which I didn't say this earlier, but I bought this at the Audubon Society which I learned what that was. I didn't know what that was but it's um a society for um like bird watching and bird care and um they had a shirt that said bird nerd on it so I bought it because I thought it was funny. But I was approached by \u2013 I want to say \u2013 at least three different people who asked me if I did bird watching like very seriously.", "human1": "In a video, Katie tells about her vacation to Portland, Oregon, and gives her top 4 recommendations for the region: Crater Lake, shopping at Powell's indie bookstore which sells used and new books, hiking in Forest Park and visiting the Rose Garden and the Japanese Gardens."}, "GUM_vlog_pregnant": {"fulltext": "Hi everyone! So I'm just about to tuck into a crisp sandwich. Salt vinegar squares are my crisp of choice. And I've got some apple juice because this signifies kind of my diet staples the last few weeks. So I thought this was an opportune time to tell you all that a couple of weeks ago I found out that I am pregnant. It's the first week that I've been actually able to say the words\" I'm pregnant\" and have it not feel really weird. I found out on, I think it was the 3rd of January. Let's just double check that. No, excuse me, it was the fifth of January. I found out on the fifth and that was because my period was late and I am never late. As soon as I came off the pill my period came back pretty regularly and I started tracking my periods just because I knew the pregnancy was something that eventually we would want, and I know that it helps if you've been tracking your period so you know your cycle. And for the first few days / couple of weeks I felt really anxious, really scared, really worried, because my initial reaction was, and still now, I'm a bit like, I'm not old enough for this. I'm not grown up enough to do this. You feel like you're prepared, you're in a, you know, in a relationship. We have been for years, we're adults, but I don't know what it is. As soon as I found out I just went back to like a 14 year old girl. I'm like \"oh my god, what am I gonna tell my mom? I can't be a mom.\" So really I was just very very overwhelmed and anxious so it took a few days for me to really process what happened. It was quite a shock and it's such a huge huge thing. It's life-changing, and so for the first couple of weeks that's all I could focus on, was how life-changing it was and it was really scary. I then started to talk to people about it, that made me feel better. And, I'm not really sure what I'm trying to say. I don't want this to be too, like, all over the place but I decided I do want to document this some way, whether I \u2013 at first I was like, I don't need to copy it on YouTube but I definitely wanted to document this in some kind of video form, just because it's such a huge thing. You\u2019re only pregnant for the first time once. But I did want to document my first trimester to an extent, because when I first found out, I did start to watch videos of people's first few weeks, but again, maybe because I wasn't in a great headspace, that just frightened me, which again was because everyone was just saying how awful they felt, how excited they were, and I didn't feel excited. I felt worried. The thought of telling, like, my mom. I cried when I told her because I felt so, just, like, oh my god. I mean you, you feel quite bad when you feel like that, because it's such a happy thing and now, you know, I \u2013 you know, I know I've kind of accepted. The shock has kind of sunk in. And I am happy to tell people, but at first when you're trying to get your head around it, it's very daunting and you just feel awful thinking. The thought of telling someone makes me want to burst into tears. All these things going onto my head. So that also then helped me to make the decision that I do want to document this, but I'm probably going to do it, like, with hindsight, so I check in every now and again and just let you know how I've been feeling. But in terms of if I am sick or I'm not feeling great, I'm not gonna vlog whilst I feel like that. I wouldn't want to vlog whilst I feel like that if I was just ill anyway. And I just think it didn't help me seeing people at their worst at the very beginning, because all you hear is doom and gloom. I decided to wait a few weeks before I even started to talk about it, so I think I'm about seven weeks. I am waiting for my first midwife appointment. I went \u2013 I booked the doctors, because the NHS says you need to book a doctor's appointment, but that was a waste of time and I felt quite bad about taking that appointment. Because in my area you'd have to self-refer, so I haven't had any kind of appointment or checkups or anything but I have been tracking \u2013 tracking \u2013 I've got an app called\" what to expect\", put in my, you know, cycle situation and have an estimated due date, which is about mid-September. In terms of symptoms, I mean I haven't felt the best, but I have been able to get through it. I've definitely struggled on some days but I haven't been sick. The biggest thing for me is I have lost \u2013 I dipped, and I have lost my appetite. There's nothing I really feel like eating. I don't have particular aversions to things, I don't feel really sick when I smell anything at the moment. But there's things that I don't want to have, so like coffee, I just know that I don't want that, and all I want is beige: I want chips, I want white toast, it's pretty much all I eat all day. Pasta if I want something hot maybe, I've had soup, but essentially starchy carbs and that's quite normal it seems. Like, everyone craves that at this point because you're, you know, building a baby, so you need that energy. So I don't feel particularly great nutrition-wise, and I'm trying to eat fruit where I can and veg when I can, but I'm just sort of going with it, because I know there's enough information out there that this is generally how it goes. And then hopefully you start to feel a bit better. I have felt nauseous and as everyone describes it, a bit jet-lagged, a bit cloudy in my head, and the worst thing for me has been headaches. I haven't had them this week, but last week I had a couple of really really bad ones and I haven't had headaches that bad for years.", "human1": "After finding out she is pregnant, a vlogger who is now seven weeks pregnant and due in mid-September tells about her feelings, her decision to document her pregnancy on her vlog, her diet and cravings, getting doctor's and midwife  appointments and experiencing nausea and headaches."}, "GUM_vlog_radiology": {"fulltext": "What's up YouTube? So we are going to do a week of me vlogging. It's kind of an interesting week. I bounced around here and there, so I have to kind of show you guys around and show you what it's all about, and today I'm on general nuclear medicine, so let's start the day. So like I said, I'm on my general nuclear medicine rotation this week. I get switched around -- moved around a few times to cover some residents who are on vacation, so I'll be at other spots later this week. So so far this morning I've just read a few studies (it's a little slow in the morning) of general nuclear medicine because a lot of stuff takes time for the radio tracers to go into the body or the specific organ we are targeting, so we have to wait a little bit in the morning. So I've done three lymphoscintigraphies. For lymphoscintigraphies we basically inject technetium in skin surrounding a melanoma and after we inject we wait about 15-20 minutes, maybe up to an hour, and wait for that radio tracer to travel to the closest lymph node which we would call the sentinel lymph node. What we do is we mark it under our cameras and then the patient will go up to the OR, have the melanoma, a wide excision of the melanoma, and then they will try to find the lymph node that we marked and take that one out as well to make sure there's no metastasis. So I've done three of those this morning. I will read a few more scans coming up here shortly and just trying to tie up some loose ends before I go to conference. I'll check back in afterwards. Ah, the sun feels so good on the face. I'm officially done. It is about 4:00 p.m. We get to head home early today because we finished off the scans, and I'm gonna go home and work out because I was too lazy to do it this morning because for some reason I was tired from having a weekend off, which makes no sense. But I'm gonna go work out, cook something for dinner and do this all over again tomorrow. We're on a different rotation tomorrow so stay tuned to find out which one. Alright it is day two. It is Tuesday and today I got pulled to ultrasound. Yes, I don't know why I got pulled on today, but I did, so probably just sit in there, read some ultrasounds and get out early. I need to film another YouTube video. Alright so I've been here just crushing ultrasounds, and today I've been feeling a little under the weather so I've been, like, yeah, I've been like crushing these all day today and then I'll show you what else I've been. I picked these up when I was in Amsterdam for ... I got sick when I was on Croatia for vacation. I have no idea what it says, but I think they're cough drops, so if anybody knows what this says let me know. But I'm pretty sure it's just cough drops with some vitamin C in it. So this is what I have been doing all day is crushing ultrasounds and having Dutch cough drops. So if anybody speaks Dutch tell me what that means. Oh and PS, I usually try to avoid taking medicines that I can't read the name of but I had someone help me at the pharmacy in the airport. She spoke a little bit of English and I think those are actually cough drops, so, that's the only reason I'm still eating them today. You can tell by my voice it's a little on the sore side today so hopefully I get better because, I haven't told you guys yet, but I'm going somewhere this weekend and it's gonna be fun. Now it's time to get back to work. So I'm officially going home right now. Yeah, normally I would go home and work out, especially since it's, like, a beautiful day I would probably go running. But since I feel kind of crappy today I'm just going to go home, hang out, rest (ambulance was a little loud sorry). So I'm probably just gonna go home and rest and I have to get my hair cut today for my big trip coming up. But you still don't know where I'm going. But yeah that's pretty much it, hope you guys don't mind this kind of like random vlog that I'm doing, but I just wanted to show you guys kind of loosely like how a week is and the life of a radiology resident. So hopefully you guys find it somewhat interesting, and if you do I'll keep doing it. So heading home now.", "human1": "A radiology resident vlogging on YouTube tells about his week on general nuclear medicine rotation, where he did three lymphoscintigraphies and some ultrasounds, his plans to work out after he gets off early from work, and taking Dutch cough drops to treat his sore throat ahead of a big trip he is planning the following weekend."}, "GUM_vlog_wine": {"fulltext": "Good morning! So remember how yesterday when I showed you the thingy thing there were like very high waves in the lagoon? Well, today is like the exact opposite. This is like the calmest water you might have seen. This is so beautiful. And I'm drinking instant coffee, but the instant coffee is actually from Bremen. That's crazy, right? In South Africa I'm drinking instant coffee that is from Bremen. Not the best representation of my city I guess, because it's instant coffee. We are heading out here at 10:00 a.m. I think, and then on the way back we're stopping at a winery for, I don't know, for looking at it, and then we're gonna head back. So firstly the Sauvignon Blanc which is for you, for you sir. So the Sauvignon Blanc, it's naturally high-acidic grape, and then if you smell it you pick up grassy aromas, lots of passion fruits, gooseberry flavors in the palate. So this is a warmer climate Sauvignon Blanc, well balanced acidity, 2018 vintage, very crisp and fresh and it is unwooded. And then the Chardonnay-Pinot Noir, it is a blended wine of 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot Noir, so it's more like a dry ros\u00e9 style of wine with lots of strawberry flavors, hints of yellow apple, and it's 2018 vintage, which is unwooded. It's very fresh and crisp. Okay? Is it a popular wine? Chardonnay? Yes, in South Africa Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's a popular wine. Interesting. And then with the Chardonnay, Chardonnay is naturally high-acidic, but not so much aromatic on the nose, so you pick up lots of citrus fruits, limes, lemons on the palate, and this is 2017 vintage, also unwooded. So these are the type of wine that you can enjoy on their own and also with your light meals, because they are made to open now, drink now wines. Can I ask you, with your white wines, how \u2013 how long \u2013 when's the best time to drink them? Is it sooner? Yes, yes, sooner. It's open now drink now wines, as I said they are lifestyle wines, easy drinking, everyday drinking styles. But if you want to keep them, I would say 5 years in the cellar. Oh, you can? Yes you can keep them in your cellar, and then the red wines, six years to seven years, not more than that. And then with the red wines from the Signature they only spent eight months in the French oak. So the reason behind that shorter period of time is for you to get more of the original flavors from the grapes, not so much of the secondary flavor since they are more level entry wines. So the Pinotage is a uniquely grown South African grape. It was discovered in the year of 1925 by a professor called Abraham Perold in the University of Stellenbosch. So it's a high grade grape that is made from Pinot Noir and the Hermitage. You took a stem of both, cross-breeded them. The Hermitage is known as the Cinsault today. So the Pinotage is very aromatic, has lots of plum fruits, red fruit flavors. The tanins are full of high tanins, but they are quite soft. This is a 2017 vintage and then the Shiraz, it's known for its biasing characteristics, that what you pick up on the palette on the nose to the palate, spicy peppery flavor, has lots of great fruits and this is 2017 vintage. And then the Cab, the Cabernet is known for its thick uh skin and it's known for when it's blended, it always acts as a backbone to the wine. So since this one had not much of the oak barrel you pick up the original black currant fruits, pencil shavings aromas, has lots of black cherries as well. This is the 2017 vintage. So this \u2013 So, so with th- with these people, it's better to wait for these as well, even though they're your everyday \u2013 Would it be better to like say \u2013 Yes, three years' time, four years' time, yes. Remember, while it gets better with age, so, these also. OK, any questions? Thank you! That's good! Yeah. Enjoy! I will bring the cheese platter. Thank you! So you heard it people: whatever she said. To make it a real wine tasting, we also got a cheese platter. Got some cheese! I'm just smelling the wine. So we just saw a wine tasting, and got to say it was really good. They gave us a little wine. I feel like my sunburn adds nicely to the effect. Wooh! I actually spit it, all of it, in here. Actually no. No you didn't. Yeah, I drank all of it. But you see all of these glasses? I drank all of them. No you actually drank a few sips \u2013 He's lying, you drank \u2013 you drank most of them. I've been called out! No but this one, this one was really really good. What's your recap? Uh \u2013 My recap? No which one's your favorite wine? Just say your favorite wine. My favorite wine is the Creative Block, yeah Creative Block 5. What's in there? It is a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec, and Petit Verdot. Got it. So what was your favorite? My favorite was the Signature Sauvignon Blanc from Spier. Lovely, lovely wine. Crisp, fruity, fresh everyday wine, good to have with fish and maybe chicken. So it's a white wine. Yeah, it's a white wine. So, white wine for you, white wine for me. For me it was actually the Creative Block 3, was this one, with Shiraz, Mourv\u00e8dre, Viognier. Actually all of us didn't choose the most expensive one. Yeah, we didn't. We had one of the very expensive ones, and actually none of us liked it the most. We all liked the inexpensive version of the Pinotage more. So, was a really good experience, and I'll, you know, gotta head home.

It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece, and therefore of Western civilization. Understand Old Athens The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis. The legend says that the King of Athens, Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 BC). This process of synoikismos \u2013 bringing together in one home \u2013 created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code (hence \"draconian\"). When this failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594). This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes (508 BC). During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under Byzantian rule. Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period. However, this fruitful period was short-lived, as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece. Modern Olympic Games Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike. Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation. Most notable among the city's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pl\u00e1ka districts. The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD. It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia, but quite interesting. Architecture Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State. Although it had a prestigious past, the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries, leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times. With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's Ottoman past. The city regained its importance in Greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past. The 20th century however, marked the rapid development of Athens. The city suffered minor damage during WWII, and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed, as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized. In the 1960s and 1970s, many 19th century neoclassical buildings, often small and private, were demolished to make way for office buildings, often designed by great Greek architects. The city also expanded outward through rash development, particularly towards the west, as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces. With the onset of the automobile, public officials reduced the city's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and, coupled with the country's new found remarkable prosperity, large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades. Over the course of the next 15 years, money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects, the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings, the gentrification of the city's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city's coastline. The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city. Athens today is ever evolving, forging a brand new identity for the 21st century. Climate Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens. Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves, but this rarely happens. Winter is definitely low season, with the occasional rainy or snowy day, but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists. Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads, on most sunny days the skies are azure blue. The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave. The government's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin.", "human1": "This article presents Athens, an ancient city and capital of modern Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million, which hosted the 2004 Olympic games and features archeological sites and restored neoclassical as well as post-modern buildings, and is best visited in spring and late autumn."}, "GUM_voyage_chatham": {"fulltext": "The Chatham Islands The Chatnam Islands (Rekohu in the indigenous Moriori language) are the eastern-most settled islands in New Zealand. The islands are in their own time zone, 45 minutes ahead of New Zealand time; the International Date Line jogs eastward to keep them on the same calendar day as the rest of New Zealand. The islands lie 860 km east of Christchurch, in the middle of the \"Roaring Forties\". Steeped in culture and history, these islands are on the very edge of civilisation. Experience Moriori culture, experience Rekohu. Understand The Chatham Islands consist of the main island, Chatham Island itself, with a population of 600, smaller Pitt Island with about 40 inhabitants, and a number of rocky outcrops. The islands are volcanic in origin and have a unique and sensitive habitat that supports many rare and endangered species. The original people of the islands are the Moriori, who were descended from the Maori of mainland New Zealand, but who developed their own culture and variant of the language. In 1835 Maori settlers from the mainland arrived, massacred and enslaved the Moriori. Get in By plane The only way for visitors to travel to the Chathams is via scheduled or chartered air service. Air Chathams fly 5 days per week, from either Christchurch, Auckland or Wellington and, seasonally, from Napier. The plane is based in the Chathams and flies to mainland New Zealand in the morning, then back to the Chathams in the afternoon. As part of New Zealand, there are no passport or visa requirements and no border controls on arrival from the mainland. You should book or ensure accommodation before you board a flight for the Chathams, as during the popular months of the tourism season, between October and April, accommodation can be severely limited. There are no same-day return flights, so once there you have to stay at least one night. Although flying to the Chathams and back is not cheap, it is worth it. Even the mainland school groups that fly there for school camps, and choose to stay at Kopinga Marae [1] get value for money by chartering a flight one way. Anyway, you don't have a choice on how you get there, unless you happen to own an aeroplane. However, when you get off that aeroplane, if you haven't pre-organised transport, you will have to walk, and it is a long way into town. By boat The only scheduled shipping service to the Chatham Islands remains the Black Robin Freighters \"Rangatira\", an antiquated, slow and small coastal trading vessel. This boat has serviced the islands for many years, but does not carry passengers. Freight charges on the Rangatira appear to be flexible and subject to change. Vessels can call at the Chathams and there are a number of \"safe\" harbours for shelter if the need arises. Remember to notify the local policeman, or Ministry of Fisheries officer if you are entering New Zealand via the Chathams. If you want a wharf berthage then call the local harbour master as you near the Chathams and he will sort you out. Get around There are several businesses on Chatham Island that will rent you a vehicle. Do not expect the flashest and latest in rental cars though. The cars \"will\" be warranted and safe, but they won't be exceptionally \"flash\". Chatham Motors have a range of nice rental vans available as well and they provide pretty good service for both visitors and locals.

Hapupu National Historic Scenic Reserve. One of only two National Historic Scenic Reserves in New Zealand (the other is the Waitangi Treaty Grounds), Hapupu is a special place, and somewhere that you will want to tell others about. Spiritually and culturally important to Moriori, it holds the last known concentration of momori-rakau, or tree carvings done by the ancestors of today's Moriori. There are many views on why they did these carvings, but whatever the reason, you will find them a very special attraction. Port Hutt. One of the most scenicly attractive ports in the whole of New Zealand, Port Hutt boasts an incredibly sheltered little harbour, with picturesque views and safe anchorage in all weather. Historically important and economically crucial for these islands today, Port Hutt is the ideal location for a short browse around and a mecca for those photography buffs [2]. Kopinga Marae. If you could define a place that will remind you of your visit to the Chathams, then this very special place will be at the top of your list. Opened in 2005, Kopinga is the official meeting place of Te Imi Moriori. Adorned with contemporary Moriori carvings and traditional taonga (treasures), the marae is a magnificent, tasteful and contemporary testament to the ancestors of Te Imi Moriori. Enjoy a guided tour of this beautiful and peaceful building. School-Camps At Kopinga Marae [3] also utilise this wonderful national treasure for hosting visiting school groups. Tommy Solomon Statue. Tame Horomona Rehe was the last known full-blooded Moriori and he passed away in 1933. He was however, not the last Moriori. His own descendants and the descendants of other Moriori live on today.

Plus, this region ranks fifth in the nation in number of major cultural resources per one million residents. Understand Cleveland from lakefront. Cleveland is the urban center of Northeast Ohio, the 15th largest combined metropolitan area in the United States. Throughout the twentieth century, the City of Cleveland proper was ranked as one of the 10 largest cities in the U.S. (from 1890 until 1970 per US Census Bureau statistics). Like most U.S. cities, Cleveland proper began to lose population to suburban areas in the 1960s and 1970s. However, in the mid-1980s, Cleveland earned the nickname the \"Comeback City\" as the urban core experienced a dramatic revitalization process that continues today. As its \"comeback\" has continued, the official moniker is now the New American City as Cleveland has rightfully earned the reputation as a model of effective public-private partnership for urban planning. Despite the common perception that Cleveland is an industrial town, just beyond the automotive and steel plants, a clean and beautiful downtown rises at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on the southern shore of Lake Erie (often marvelled over by visitors who are surprised you can't see the other side, i.e., Canada). Like other cities in the so-called \"rust belt\u201c, Cleveland has endured growing pains as it makes its transition from a manufacturing-based economy. While Cleveland continues to play a leading role in building the U.S. industrial base, it has also developed economic prowess in the fields of health care, law, finance, insurance, real estate development, and professional services. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum Another thing non-locals don't often realize is that Cleveland's long history of industrial wealth has left it chock full of cultural riches as well as the beginnings of a \"sustainable city\" movement. Serving as a global model for urban rebirth, Cleveland has been named one of the top 10 international visitor hotspots by Travel and Leisure magazine. For decades, the city has boasted of: a \"Big Five\" orchestra (The Cleveland Orchestra), the second largest performing arts center in the U.S. (Playhouse Square Center), a world-renowned art museum (The Cleveland Museum of Art), the nation's first health museum (HealthSpace Cleveland), R&D hub of the aerospace and aviation industry (the NASA Glenn Research & Visitors Center) and a number of other first-rate attractions (too many to mention here - read on).

It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations. Background Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga, and the name of a different, smaller island just offshore. The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving, and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world. In September 1944, a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy. The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef. There are also attractions on Coron Island itself. There are many beautiful white sand beaches, mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife. Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations, and good for snorkeling, and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night. History The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago. They were a nomadic, seafaring people, living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture. Although they are now sedentary (with the young using cell phones, etc.), they maintain many of their old customs, traditions and beliefs. Today, the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron. In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron. From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II, the municipality experienced the mining boom. Labor shifted from farming to mining. In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines. On September 24, 1944, a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay. To this day, about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world. In 1947, large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron, and the town experienced another boom, a fishing boom. The population increased, as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners. On June 17, 1950, Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954, Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan. On September 12, 1992, Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion. In the past, Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan. It remains a small, quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing, slowly but steadily, Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry. In the past decade, there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in, making tourism the major industry player in Coron today.", "human1": "This overview of the history of Coron, a fishing town on the island of Busuanga in the Philippines, tells about the local people (Tagbanuas), the shift from farming to mining, fishing, and more recently tourism, and attractions such as stunning lakes, snorkeling, and wreck diving to see around ten Japanese ships sunk by the US Navy in World War II."}, "GUM_voyage_cuba": {"fulltext": "Get in For information specific to U.S. citizens see Americans in Cuba Visa and legal issues A tourist visa card (visa de tarjeta del turista) is necessary for travelers from most nations. This visa, which is really little more than a piece of paper on which you list your vital statistics, costs between 15 - 25 CUC (or \u20ac 15 - 25), depending on where purchased. It can be purchased at the Airport in Cuba on arrival, however it should be noted that many airlines will require a valid tourist visa card before boarding flights. It is usually valid for 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at any immigration office in Cuba (for 25 CUC) - beyond this you would need a flight out of Cuba within the extended visa period. Canadians are the exception, getting 90 days on arrival and can apply for a 90 day extension. Your passport needs to be valid at least six months past the end of your planned return. Canadian passports must be valid for at least one month beyond the date of expected departure ([2]). From Canada, the tourist card is normally provided on the flight. It can also be purchased from most Latin American gateway airports if departing from there (Cancun: 250 MXN, Mexico City: USD 25). Please note that if departing from Europe (this may apply to other countries), you will require to have the visa before boarding the plane. Some times, the airline provides these at the airport, however check first that this is the case. Without a valid visa, boarding will be denied (the airline would otherwise get a $ 1,000 fine from the Cuban immigration authorities). Country-specific advise UK: Applying for the visa is a very simple process and can be done by post or in person at the Cuban embassy in London. When applying to the Cuban Consulate by post, there is a new charge introduced in 2011 which is a \u00a3 25 for a non-personal transaction. If you cannot go to the Cuban Consulate you may consider using VisaCuba ([3]) because it may be cheaper. Through them it may cost \u00a3 20 in total per person. If you apply in person to the Cuban Consulate, you get the visa straight away. It can also be done through online agencies as mentioned before although they may be slightly more expensive (normally \u00a3 15 + \u00a3 15 admin fee and additional postage). Germany: You can obtain the tourist card through the Cuban embassy in post. Travel agencies may often offer cheaper and quicker services though. Regular tourists who renew their 30 day visa are eligible to depart the country (to any destination) and return immediately enjoying a further 60 days (30 days plus a 30 day extension). You are only allowed two consecutive stays in this manner. If you want to stay with friends or family in Cuba you have to go with your intended host within two days after arrival to a migration office and pay 40 CUC for a 30 days family visa.

One of the architectural masterpieces of Safavid Iranian architecture, this mosque is considered to be the most beautiful in Iran. Built in 1602 by Shah Abbas I.= and designed by his chief architect, Sheikh Bahai. The mosque was designed to be a private mosque for the royal family and therefore it does not have any minarets.

Unlike most other large Polish cities, which have long histories, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was created almost from scratch during the 19th century textile industry boom to house textile mills, their owners and their workers, and rapidly grew to become an important industrial and commerce centre. In recent years, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has been battling rising unemployment and youth migration resulting from the failing textile industry and is repositioning itself as a hub for design and creative industries. Owing to its history, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has an impressive collection of residential, commercial and industrial 19th-century architecture including some of Europe's largest factory buildings, now mostly repurposed as shopping centres or lofts. Recent local investment and a long-standing cultural scene ensures there is always something more to do than just sightseeing or shopping, with the city hosting some of the best museums and art galleries in the country. The close proximity of Warsaw and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a's location at the crossroads of the Polish motorway system make it an ideal destination for a day trip or longer city break. Understand Historic fire station in Ksi\u0119\u017cy M\u0142yn area Name and history The origin of the city's name is unknown, however, the word \u0142\u00f3d\u017a translates to \"boat\" in English. This is referred to in the emblem and when you hear the dwellers of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (\u0142odzianin (man) \u0142odzianka (woman) \u0142odzianie (plural)) calling themselves \"the boat people\". A settlement on the area of present-day \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was established in the 14th century and in 1423 it was granted a town charter, along with the right to have a marketplace. However, the real development of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a started with the industrial era at the beginning of the 19th century when the city was chosen to be the heart of the rapidly-growing textile industry. The population of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a soared from some 4,000 people in the 1830s and 40,000 in 1865 to over 300,000 inhabitants at the turn of the century, which was an unprecedented growth on a worldwide scale. The rapid development of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in the second half of the 19th century was brought about by the rise of enormous industrialist fortunes. New inhabitants, craftsmen and merchants came to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a; markets and town fairs came to life. The profits obtained from prosperous textile mills opened up practically unlimited possibilities for their owners. The city residences became expressions of the riches and power of the local tycoons. They were usually situated next to the owner's factory. Ever since the industrial revolution brought a massive influx of workforce, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a had been a city almost equally divided between four cultures - Polish, Jewish, German and Russian. The day before the outbreak of World War II, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was inhabited by approximately 672,000 people, among whom 35% were of Jewish faith and some 15% were ethnic German. Andrzej Wajda's movie, Promised Land based on a novel by the Nobel laureate W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont, depicts those times and is a worthwhile introduction to the city's bustling history. During the Nazi occupation, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was incorporated directly into the Third Reich. The city was renamed to Litzmannstadt, and Piotrkowska Street was called Adolf-Hitler-Strasse. The Jewish community was practically wiped out, and many others lost their lives. Although the city was not destroyed in the aftermath, the material losses were serious as the machinery, raw materials and finished goods were taken away by the fleeing Nazis. The day before the liberation, about 80,000 Germans left \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in panic. At the beginning of 1945, the population was estimated at 300,000. Plac Wolno\u015bci \u0141\u00f3d\u017a today Since the fall of communism in Poland, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has not enjoyed the rapid economic growth cities like Krak\u00f3w, Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw have experienced, and has had to endure the fall of much of its textile industry, rising unemployment and emigration (within Poland and abroad). This led to further dilapidation of the investment-starved city, and many of its streets and buildings show profound signs of neglect. At first glance, for a city of 760,000 and agglomeration of 1.428,000, there does not seem to be much to see. However, the situation is rapidly changing now with \u0141\u00f3d\u017a campaigning and redesigning itself as an up-and-coming destination. To accomplish this, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a has been capitalizing on its film history - \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is jokingly referred to as the \"Holly\u0141\u00f3d\u017a\" of Poland and hosts several film festivals and many other cultural events. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a today may not have the glitz and glamour of its heyday; however, there is a certain charm to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a in its partially renovated fa\u00e7ades and leitmotivs, not to mention its grand artistic traditions.", "human1": "This article goes over the history of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland's third biggest city with 760,000 people, its prosperity in the 19th century textile industry boom, the Nazi occupation in World War II which wiped out its Jewish population and killed many others, its subsequent dilapidation, and its recent campaigns to host film festivals and cultural events."}, "GUM_voyage_merida": {"fulltext": "M\u00e9rida M\u00e9rida is the capital of the state of Yucat\u00e1n in Mexico.

Founded in 1871, it has become the region's primary political, cultural, economic, and transportation center. At an elevation of 1100 ft (335 m), it is situated in the biologically unique Sonoran Desert. Over time it has merged with the neighboring cities of Scottsdale, Tempe, Glendale, Peoria, Chandler, and Gilbert to form the Greater Phoenix Metropolitan Area. Currently exurbs such as Apache Junction, Fountain Hills, Queen Creek, and Sun City are becoming part of this metropolitan area as well. Phoenix is extremely hot and dry in the summertime, so always have sunscreen with you! Understand Why would anybody want to start a city in the middle of a desert? The answer is, surprisingly, agriculture. The Salt and Verde Rivers of central Arizona were exploited for large-scale agriculture by Native Americans as early as the 11th century. The area that now encompasses Phoenix was a center of the Hohokam culture, which built large canal systems and a network of towns and villages, whose remains may be viewed in the city to this day. White settlers discovered the remnants of the Hohokam culture in the 19th century. The city's name reflects its history as a city \"reborn from the ashes\" of the previous settlement. European-American settlement of the area commenced in the 1860s, and in 1911 the completion of the first of several large reservoirs in the mountains north and east of Phoenix insured its success as a center for irrigation-based agriculture. Many tens of thousands of acres were planted in citrus and cotton and other crops, and for many years, intensive, year-round irrigated agriculture formed the basis of the economy. Recent years are seeing a revival, and trendy hotels, bars, shops and restaurants are making it a place to be again. Warm and sunny winter weather also ensured a thriving tourism industry, and encouraged many Easterners and Midwesterners to relocate to Phoenix. High-tech industry began to flourish after World War II, and since that time the growth of Phoenix has been explosive. As a result, a population of just over 100,000 in 1950 has given way to a 2014 estimate of 1,537,058 (with the metro area estimated at 4,489,109). Climate Phoenix has an arid climate with long, hot summers and very mild winters. It has the highest average temperature of any metropolitan area in the States. The weather varies enormously from one season to the next. While it's not as cold as in the northern states during the winter, it does freeze sometimes, and temperatures in the 30s \u00b0 F (that's around or slightly above 0 \u00b0 C) are not unheard of. In the summer, very hot and dry heat is the norm. On the hottest days, it can get up to 115 \u00b0 F (46 \u00b0 C) or more. Monsoon rains with lightning occur regularly from July to September during the late afternoon and evening, occasionally overnight also. April is the most ideal month. In some neighborhoods, cicada insects make loud sounds from sunset to sunrise. Talk English is the dominant language in Phoenix. However, like much of the Southwest with a large Hispanic population, Spanish is very widely spoken in Phoenix. Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places, although English is the language of preference, especially when dealing with businesses and government.

However, Socotra is a perfect destination for the adventurous and nature loving travelers. Socotra takes pride in their eco-tourism and values their spectacular plant and wildlife that may sometimes be only found on this island.

Great care is shown to both guests and the environment. Socotra is an eco-tourism system with limited infrastructure and new to the international tourist market, and therefore the hotel accommodations are not quite like other destinations. However there are four hotels in Hadibo: Taj Socotra Hotel, Hafijj Hotel, Socotra Hotel, and Summer land Hotel. These hotels may not be the most luxerious, but they do provide air-conditionting, televisions, and refrigerators in all of the rooms. Most of the rooms at these hotels have their own bathroom, but there are a few rooms at the Hafijj Hotel and Socotra Hotel that must share bathrooms. Fortunately, there is a restaurant in each of the hotels with simple yet delicious cuisine. Considering Socotra is a fairly new eco-tourism destination, their facilities are decent. In addition, there is also another hotel at the airport as well as multiple guest houses around the island. The most popular lodging is actually camping on the beaches. There are several campsites that allow tourists to barbeque on the beach with beautiful mountain views in the background. Tourists can choose to purchase camping tour packages which include a driver or guide that will show tourists around the beaches as well as provide meals during their stay. It is a fantastic way to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the island. A runway that provides fairly regular airline transportation was only constructed in 1999. Like everything else, infrastructure and transportation has only just begun in recent years. There are also plans for new harbor facilities that will allow fisherman to sell and catch more easily and make importing food and fuel simpler. In addition, there are also two information centers located at the airport and Hadibo. When to go: Climate is an important consideration. And this depends on your interest. Nature enthusiasts should go from early October to late April.

See Socotra is considered the jewel of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea. Although the region is small, it is characterized by unique land and marine biodiversity. The interior of the island is dominated by the beautiful and green Hagghier mountains and limestone plateau. While on the outer coastline, breathtaking natural beaches have pure white sand dunes and palm trees. Socotra Island is very rich and is home to many rare spectacular species of reefs, fish, birds, plants, and trees which are not found anywhere else in the world. The limestone plateau and the Hagghier Mountains are the richest areas for endemic plant species, but endemics are found throughout the island in every type of vegetation. One of the most famous plants is the dragon's blood tree \u201cdracaena cinnabara\u201d which exists only on Socotra and nowhere else on the Earth. The tree got its name because if any damage is made to the bark then a dark red liquid oozes out. The dragon's blood tree thrives in Socotra's arid climate There is also the Desert Rose (adenium obesium) which looks like a blooming elephant leg. Also found in Socotra's landscape is the ever-strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree. In addition there are over 120 species of birds and about 190 species of butterflies.

It is one of Denmark's most scenic areas, and should be a top destination of anyone taking the time to explore Denmark outside the capital. Understand The islands were formed during the last ice age, by ice sliding over the area from the south, only the ancient hilltops was spared from submersion, and forms the many islands and islets peaking above the sea everywhere. The area has a milder climate than the country's average, and because of this, is home to flora and fauna not seen anywhere else in Denmark. There are strong local movements to convert the area into a National Park. Flora & fauna The area is one of the most diverse natural environments in the country, and is designated as an international wildlife protection area, as it is home of several rare and protected species. If you are interested ornithology the many shallow waters around the islands and islets is a treat with thousands of birds and colonies, one of the more notable is the Arctic Tern, which migrates to Antarctica and back (nearly 40,000 kilometers) every year. This is the longest regular migration by any known animal. You also find Shore Crabs, Beach Otters and - rare for Denmark - Seals in the shallow waters and beaches.

Get around Bringing a car to the islands serves little point but to rob your wallet of your hard earned cash, and you will be much better served by bringing or renting a bike in Svendborg or Faaborg, or just simply walk since the islands are generally small enough to make this feasible. While some islands are connected by the same ferry, you will generally have to go back to the mainland to pass between the islands, if you rely on public transportation.

As a foreign visitor, you are not expected to know how to wai, nor to reciprocate when wai'd to; while you're unlikely to cause offense if you do, you may well look slightly strange. If somebody makes a wai to you, a slight bow alone is more than sufficient for ordinary occasions, and for business, most Thais will shake hands with foreigners instead of waiing anyway. Dress Personal appearance is very important in Thailand as a measure of respect to other people. You will find that dressing appropriately means that you are shown more respect in return. This translates in many ways, even sometimes lowering initial offering prices at markets. While some allowance is made for the differing customs of foreigners, Thais respond more positively to well-dressed Westerners. Traditionally, Thais are modest and conservative dressers. At a minimum your clothes should be neat, clean, and free from holes or tears. Except at the beach or at sacred sites normal western dress is acceptable for both men and women, except that you should avoid clothing showing a lot of skin. Pants are preferable to shorts, blouses should have capped sleeves, and if tank tops are worn, the straps should be thick (i.e., not spaghetti straps). Thai men generally wear pants, and most Thais view an adult man wearing shorts as fairly ridiculous; shorts are primarily worn by laborers and schoolchildren. Men's shorts should be knee length or more, if worn at all. Taking off one's shoes at temples and private homes is mandatory etiquette, and this may even be requested at some shops. Wear shoes that slip on and off easily. Flip-flops, hiking sandals, and clog-type shoes are usually a good pragmatic choice for traveling in Thailand; only in the most top-end establishments are shoes required. It is best to play it safe with wats and other sacred sites in Thailand; your dress should be unambiguously modest and cover your entire torso and most of your limbs. For men, ankle-length pants are mandatory; on top, t-shirts are acceptable, though a button-front or polo shirt would be best. Many recommend that women wear only full length dresses and skirts; you should make sure that your clothing covers at least your shoulders and your knees and some places may require that you wear ankle-length pants or skirts and long sleeved tops. Shorts and sleeveless shirts are highly inappropriate, as are short skirts. The rules are even more strict for foreign visitors, so even if you see a local in shorts it's not OK for everyone. Topless sunbathing is common by Western women at many tourist beaches. At beaches which are primarily Thai visitors however, this is not advised. Religion Buddhist prayer flags, Wat Arun, Bangkok Monks are an integral part of Buddhism in Thailand, and Thai men are generally expected to spend a certain amount of time living as a monk at least once in their lifetime. Buddhist monks are meant to avoid sexual temptations, and in particular they do not touch women or take things from women's hands. Women should make every effort to make way for monks on the street and give them room so they do not have to make contact with you. Women should avoid offering anything to a monk with their hands. Objects or donations should be placed in front of a monk so he can pick it up, or place it on a special cloth he carries with him. Monks will sometimes be aided by a layman who will accept things from women merit-makers on their behalf. Theravada Buddhist monks are also supposed to avoid material temptations and as such, are not allowed to touch money, so offering money to a monk is considered to be a sign of disrespect in most Theravada Buddhist cultures. Therefore, should you wish to donate to a monk, you should only offer food, and put your monetary donation in the appropriate donation box at the temple. Those monks that accept money are almost always fakes.", "human1": "This article explains how and when to perform the respectful Wai hand gesture as a tourist in Thailand, how to dress appropriately at beaches and temples (e.g. taking off shoes at temples and homes), and how to interact with monks, including women not touching or handing things to them and not offering money to Theravada Buddhist monks."}, "GUM_voyage_tulsa": {"fulltext": "Tulsa Tulsa is in the Green Country region of Oklahoma. It is also called \u201cT-town\u201d by the locals and has been called the \"Oil Capital of the World\". The city had about 391,000 people and the metro area had about 937,000 people as of 2010 from the US Census Bureau. The Tulsa Bartlesville Combined area had 988,000 in the 2010 census. Understand Tulsa lies in northeastern Oklahoma, at the convergence of the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau, and receives an average of 40 inches of precipitation each year, both of which account for its abundant beautiful rolling green terrain. As a result, Tulsa breaks the Oklahoma stereotype of being nothing but a flat, arid dust bowl. Summers can be very warm and with the cold wind across the plains it can get very cold in the winter, but it does not last long. The winters are considered to be very mild. There is not much snow, just a few inches each year, typically, although in 2007 and again in 2008 there were rather large \"ice storms\". Tulsa has over 225 days of sunshine annually. In Tulsa you will find old west charm as well as a cosmopolitan atmosphere. You will find the people of Tulsa love their city and they have that southern charm, so they are willing to help you find your way around. Tulsa has one of the largest concentrations of Art Deco in the nation, having been a booming city during the 1920s when the architecture was first built by rich oil barons who built stately mansions and turned the Downtown area into a treasure trove of art. Get in By plane Tulsa International Airport (IATA: TUL) in the northern part of Tulsa. It has major airlines with direct flights to major cities in the U.S. It is a small but nice airport with sofas and chairs all around and a very laid-back feel. The car rental area and parking is well integrated. The airport offers free short term parking (first half-hour free). Richard L. Jones, Jr. Airport (IATA: RVS) (often called the \"Riverside Airport\") is south of downtown and is a general aviation airport. By train There is no passenger train service to Tulsa. By car Most Tulsans drive almost everywhere, although bus, bike, and pedestrian routes are starting to catch on. From the North / Kansas - US-75 South from Bartlesville, OK, or US-169 South from Coffeyville, KS. From the Northeast / Missouri - I-44 West, aka the \"Will Rogers Turnpike.\" The world's former largest McDonalds spans the roadway near Vinita, OK. From the East / Arkansas - US-412 West, aka the \"Cherokee Turnpike.\" From the Southeast / Arkansas - The \"Muskogee Turnpike.\" From the South - US-75 from Okmulgee, OK, aka the \"Okmulgee Beeline.\" From the Southwest / Oklahoma City - I-44 East, aka the \"Turner Turnpike.\" From the West - US-412 East, aka the \"Cimarron Turnpike.\" For the slow scenic route from Northeast or Southwest come in on old Route 66. By bus Greyhound Bus Lines +1918584-4428, 317 S Detroit Ave. (downtown). Get around Thanks to urban planning, the major city streets are placed in a grid layout. Almost all major intersections are one mile from each other, and exactly in a straight line. That makes it much easier to find places than in cities where streets go every which way. The major exception is downtown, which is slanted at almost a 45 degree angle to the rest of the grid. By car Several freeways and bypasses can be used to easily get around the Tulsa Metro area: I-244, I-44, US 169 (Mingo Valley Expressway, aka \"Pearl Harbor Memorial Expressway\"), US 75, Hwy 51 (Broken Arrow Expressway, The \"B.A.\"), Creek Turnpike. The streets and avenues are planned on a 1 mile by 1 mile grid system, with the main arterials running on each mile. In the core of the city, named avenues run north / south and are named after US cities, generally in repeating alphabetical order (for example, Winston - Yale - Allegheny - Braden). In the mid-town area the names are taken from colleges and college towns. North / South is divided by Admiral Blvd. Name streets East of Main are cities east of the Mississippi River, vice versa for name streets west of Main. In the parts of the city farther from downtown, north-south streets are numbered. It is important to recognize that the specific format of the north-south numbered street names is North / South 145th East / West Avenue. Numbered streets run East / West with Main Street and the Arkansas River as the dividing line. Watch out for Place, Street, Avenue designation, e.g. 47th Place, 47th Street, or Florence Place, Florence Avenue. It is important to recognize that the specific format of the east-west numbered street names is West / East 71st Street North / South. In some parts of the city, numbered streets intersect, so the distinction is important. Although rare, one east-west numbered street may even intersect with a street of the same number running north-south. Downtown streets were originally platted parallel to the Frisco railroad tracks. When Tulsa expanded beyond the bounds of its original plat, the expanded areas were platted in alignment with the points of the compass. Thus the \"twisted\" area down-town represents the original extent of Tulsa ca 1907. By bus Tulsa Transit provides bus service for the Tulsa Metro area. Cities served are Tulsa, Sand Springs, Sapulpa, Jenks, and Broken Arrow. The central station is at 319 S. Denver (downtown). They do not run that often, especially to the outer towns like Broken Arrow. Unlike major cities in the Northeast, the city bus is not a major form of transportation in the city. It is usually a means of travel for those who are without their own motor vehicle. By bicycle Tulsa has an extensive interconnected paved bike trail system. Rivertrail follows the Arkansas River from downtown Tulsa south to the suburbs. The Katy Trail runs west to Sand Springs. The Osage Trail is a rails-to-trails route that begins at the OSU-Tulsa campus and travels north 15 miles to Skiatook. The Creek Trail connects Rivertrail and continues east through Broken Arrow to the NSU-Broken Arrow campus. Riders accustomed to flat terrain may find Tulsa's rolling land to be a bit more challenging, particularly during the heat of summer. If you are looking for a good workout, the Creek Turnpike Trail follows the land's original contours. Rivertrail is probably be best choice for the rider seeking an easy route. Four bike loan depots, located along Rivertrail, allow riders to borrow a bike for free for up to twenty-four hours. Tulsa has an active bicycling community.", "human1": "This guide to Tulsa, Oklahoma (population 391,000, metro area 937,000), a city rich in 1920s Art Deco, gives weather and geographical information, as well as detailed plane, car and bicycle route information."}, "GUM_voyage_york": {"fulltext": "York York is an ancient cathedral city with a history that dates back to before Roman times. It is situated in Yorkshire, North Yorkshire, England with some of the best preserved historical buildings and structures in Europe. As of the 2001 census, the population of York was 181,000. York is frequently ranked (often vying with Manchester) the second most visited city in England after London. York Minster Understand York was known as Eboracum by the Romans, who founded the fortress city on the River Ouse in the year 71. York was home first to the Ninth Legion and later the Sixth. York quickly became one of the most important cities in Roman Britain, and after 211 became the capital of the province Britannia Inferior. Constantine the Great - later responsible for making Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire - was first proclaimed Emperor in the city. Captured by the Vikings 866, the city quickly took on a new identity as Jorvik (pronounced \"Yor-vik\") and experienced a major urban revival as a centre of Viking trade and settlement in northern England. The Coppergate excavations of the 1970s revealed much of this Viking past. York is a fairly small city - four days is enough to see the major sights although York is a city that reveals its charms to explorers with curiosity and patience. York is known as England's \"City of Festivals \"as there are regular cultural festivals every year. The official festivals are the Viking Festival, the Festival of Angels, Early Music, Late Music, Horse Racing (the \"Ebor Race Meeting\"), Multicultural Food and Arts, Chinese New Year, Mystery Plays, Christmas St Nicholas' Fair, and the Food and Drink Festival. It's a romantic city for a weekend break. York is full of magic and a wonderful place to bring children! Get in Most travellers will arrive in York by road (car or bus) or rail from other parts of the UK or an airport. By car Although York is not directly on any of the main north-south motorways, the connections are reasonably good. From the south, the quickest route is probably to take the M1 northbound to junction 32, then the M18 eastbound to junction 2, the A1M northbound to junction 44 and finally the A64 eastbound to the York Outer Ring Road (A1237). Alternatively, you can take the M1 all the way to the A64, but the upper reaches of the M1 around Sheffield and Leeds can get very congested, especially in the rush hours. From the west, the A59 and the M62 provide connections from Liverpool and Manchester, and from the north the A1 and the A19 link York with Tyneside, Northumberland and south-eastern Scotland. Driving into the city centre itself is something to avoid. Traffic congestion on the main arterial roads serving the city (especially the A19 on Bootham and the Inner Ring Road) can get very bad, especially during the rush hours and on Saturday mornings. The remodelling of some roads near bottleneck junctions to accommodate bicycle lanes has made traffic jams even worse still in recent years, and parking in the city centre is very expensive. If you are just visiting York for the day, using a Park and Ride [1] costs a lot less than trying to park in or near the city centre, and there are five sites dotted around the Outer Ring Road. However, the last buses from the city centre leave at around 8 pm in the evenings and you are not allowed to leave your car in a Park and Ride overnight. Therefore, if you are staying overnight in York and arriving by car, make sure that your hotel offers parking before you book. If you are only visiting for the day but staying until late evening, you will need to use a city centre car park.", "human1": "This guide to York, a Cathedral city in Yorkshire, England, with a population of 181,000, tells of its Roman and Viking era history, its renown for holding annual cultural festivals, and information about roads into the city, congested traffic and expensive parking."}, "GUM_whow_arrogant": {"fulltext": "How to Detect Arrogant People Do you always seem to cross paths with people who are stuck on themselves, intolerant of people different from them, rude or downright arrogant? These people can be a great source of potential pain, and this article is here to help you sort the arrogant from the not-so-arrogant. Steps Pay attention to their conversations. Don't eavesdrop, but when they're talking to you or to those around you, listen to them. Is it always about them? Do they get mad or irritated if the centre of attention moves to someone else? These are good signs of arrogance. Arrogance and smugness is often a reflection of limited life experience, and feeling concerned that those with greater life experience \"have got something over them\". Rather than seeking to find out more through questions and learning (actions viewed by them as showing vulnerability), arrogant people tend to generalize from their limited, narrow life experiences and try to impose their small worldview on others. Jealousy of your achievements or seeming lifestyle can cause another person to feel smug or arrogant about something they think they do better than you or own / have that you don't. Arrogant people have an extremely strong need to look good. When you make them look bad - even if it is the slightest offense - they will usually be very mad at you. This happens when you question (or at least seem to question) their appearance, intelligence, athletic abilities, or anything else relating to their self-image. Challenge their worldview. Don't be aggressive \u2013\u2013 just skeptical and curious. If they get upset, gauge their anger. If it's minimal, they may be simply having a bad day. But if they're enraged, then they may see you as questioning their 'perfect little world.' And having one of those is usually indicative of arrogance. At some point or another, most people realize that the world doesn't revolve around them. Arrogant people counteract this by creating an atmosphere that revolves around them, and get angry if they're reminded of the real world. Ambiguity frightens arrogant people because it suggests imperfection, change and lack of certainty (realities we all must contend with as best we can). As such, instead of accepting that the world behaves randomly and at times totally averse to one's preferences, the arrogant person seeks to control everything and everyone, which of course, is an impossible mission. Reality hurts when it intrudes; as such, an arrogant person is less likely than other people to self-reflect or analyse, thereby not seeing their own imperfections. They may also give themselves undue credit for positive achievements instead of acknowledging the input of others or of circumstances. Learn the quality of their friendships. Don't be nosy or gossipy, but if they are happy with someone one day and hateful with them the next, that's a sign of them having a lot of fair weather friends. That's a sign of arrogance, since it is very hard to be a truly good friend to someone who's stuck on themselves. Prideful people have a strong need to look good, and being self-sufficient is an effective way to do that. Since being a good friend to someone usually means helping them, they often can't stand the thought of a good friendship. Ironically, arrogant people often can't understand why they don't have any reliable and supportive friends. How do they treat those not like themselves? In other words, how do they treat those with different beliefs, cultural backgrounds and ways of seeing the world? If it's inherently negative, then they're either over-zealous, ignorant of other people or what to avoid those that contradict their fantasy land that caters to them and them only. Determine this based on their general personality and the people they're interacting with. Many times prideful people have a serious 'my-way's-the-only-way' attitude. This is simply a protective mechanism for their false image or their fantasy land. What's their personality like? Take note of how they act, talk, and use their social status. Do they have a general sense of 'coolness?' Are they a chatterbox? Do they act like they own the place, or act like the 'big dog?' Are they very keen on their self-image? Many arrogant people have a false charm that no one seems to see through. But the arrogant person is usually more than happy to show their cruel side to those that they don't like. When they are cruel, their friends will usually ignore it or not do anything to stop it since they're afraid that they'll be treated badly by their 'friend.' Mention people you know that they don't like. This isn't meant to begin a conflict, but to gauge their rivalries, annoyances and enmities. If their condemnation seems to be reasonable, they probably aren't hubristic. If it's harsh, they are. For the most part, arrogant people see people that they don't like as threats to their perfect little world. The more they hate someone, the more dangerous that person is to their fantasy land. And in turn, the bigger the threat, the harsher the criticism. Ask around to see what they've been saying about you. If they have been saying bad things about you, they may simply not like you. If they're nice to your face, but talk bad about you behind your back like it's their favourite hobby, then they probably have a problem with pride. Arrogant people often subconsciously know that they don't have any good friends. They compensate for this by creating the impression that they have a lot of friends - they have a 'quantity, not quality' mentality. Then they simply insult their trophy friends when they aren't looking.", "human1": "This guide tells how to detect arrogant people based on signs such as irritation when they are not the center of attention, a strong need to look good and getting mad when their 'perfect world' is threatened, sudden hatefulness to friends or a cruel side shown to those they don't like, and speaking badly about you behind your back."}, "GUM_whow_ballet": {"fulltext": "How to Ballet Dance Ballet began in royal courts in the early 1600's, and early forms of this elegant and sophisticated art involved long skirts and wooden clogs. Dancing ballet is extremely popular throughout the world, and studying ballet can help develop strong bodies, spatial and temporal awareness, and improve coordination. People who study ballet also retain flexibility throughout their adult lives, making this technique the basis of training for all types of dance. While dancing ballet takes dedication and requires serious training, you can learn the basics to prepare yourself for further study. Learn to get ready for practicing, the basic positions, and some of the first techniques you're likely to encounter in ballet. Part 1 Getting Ready to Dance Stretch your muscles thoroughly. Stretching is important to loosen muscles, strengthen muscles and to elongate your posture. It is vital that it is done at the beginning of each ballet session, including before a performance. When taking on ballet, it is important to stretch daily for at least 15 - 30 minutes, to give the muscles ample opportunity to warm up, reducing the risk of injury. You should also stretch to \"wind down\" at the end of ballet dancing. Always wear ballet slippers. Properly-fitted ballet shoes should be snug, but not so tight they cut off blood flow and create numbness in the feet. There are different styles and types of shoes, so ask your ballet teacher or a salesman at the store for advice, given your intentions for dancing. Don't buy shoes to grow into, because your feet will seem flexed when you pointe and will look flat. You should fit them to where the drawstring is tied slightly loose. If your drawstring is longer than your pinkie then you should cut it off till it is roughly the size of your fingernail. The drawstring just completes the fit. It isn't made to tighten overly large shoes. If you can't buy ballet shoes, that it is okay. Use socks without the stickies on the bottom, so you can turn! Wear comfortable and snug-fitting athletic clothes. The most important thing is that you are comfortable, and that you're not wearing baggy or loose fitting clothing so you can make sure you're forming and moving correctly in the mirror. A plain black leotard and pink tights are usually a safe bet. Pink or black ballet slippers are also appropriate. If you're signed up for a class, check with your instructor to find out if there is a dress code at the school. Some schools may have students wear the same thing and others may just require any type of leotard and tights and sometimes ballet skirts. Mostly they require tight fitting clothing so they can see that your muscles are working properly and so on. Find an appropriate space to practice. Ballet is less about learning the moves and more about perfecting them. The moves themselves are relatively straightforward, but the positing, the timing, and the elegance required takes a lifetime of practice. For this reason, it's always better to practice ballet in a ballet studio under the guidance of a good instructor, who will be able to correct your positioning and make sure that you're dancing properly. A dancing studio is equipped with mirrors for correcting your positioning and seeing what you're doing accurately, and a barre for practicing. [1] If you want to practice at home, make sure you've got enough open space to move freely, preferably on a hard wood floor. The back of a chair can replace the need for a bar. Position a large mirror so you can check your positioning and see what you're doing.", "human1": "This section of a ballet dancing guide explains some of ballet's history and popularity and gives practical advice on stretching before and after dancing, wearing properly fitted slippers or else socks without stickies on the bottom, wearing snug comfortable clothes such as a leotard and tights, and finding space to practice, ideally in a studio with a barre."}, "GUM_whow_basil": {"fulltext": "How to Grow Basil Three Methods: Starting Seeds Caring for Basil Harvesting and Using Basil Basil is easy to grow, and transforms ordinary meals into culinary treasures! Fresh basil not only tastes better than dried, it actually tastes different, almost as if it were not the same herb. This article outlines how to plant and harvest basil. Method 1 of 3: Starting Seeds 1 Choose the kind of basil you wish to grow. Basil comes in many different varieties, each of which have a unique flavor and smell. Read up on different types of basil and pick out one - or several - that appeal to you, then order the seeds or buy them at a garden store. Here are a few ideas: Cinnamon basil really does smell like the sweet spice, and it also has unusually beautiful and fragrant flowers. Lemon basil actually contains citral, an aromatic compound found in citrus fruit, and smells very lemony. Purple basil is often grown for decoration, as well as its scent and flowers. There are perennial basils which come back year after year, like African Blue Basil (which has pretty blue veins on its leaves) and Thai Basil, while most other varieties are annuals, which you'll have to plant year after year. Globe and Greek basil are much more difficult to grow, but form pretty little bushes which stay well-contained. 2 Start seed indoors four to six weeks before last frost. Basil needs warm air and sun to do well, so it's often easiest to start the seeds indoors instead of risking that they'll get damaged by frost. If you live in a hot climate, you can start the seeds outside instead. To figure out when the last frost will be, consult an almanac or talk with other gardeners in your area. 3 Prepare seed containers. Fill flats or individual seed containers with a mixture of equal parts perlite, vermiculite, and peat. Press the mixture slightly to eliminate air pockets. Dampen the mixture with water so it's ready to provide the right environment for the basil seeds to germinate. 4 Plant the seeds. Drop one to two seeds into each container. Cover them lightly with soil. Cover containers with clear plastic kitchen wrap, so they stay moist. Leave the containers in a sunny window. Twice daily, remove the plastic wrap and sprinkle the containers with more water. 5 Remove the plastic wrap when the sprouts emerge. When you see the first green tendrils push up through the soil, it's time to remove the plastic wrap. Keep watering the sprouts twice daily, never letting the soil dry out. When the plants become a few inches tall and their leaves mature, it's time to transplant them to a larger container. Method 2 of 3: Caring for Basil 1 Transplant the basil plants. Once two sets of leaves have formed, basil can be planted into the garden or permanent containers. Basil does not tolerate frost so don't plant too early. It's best to put basil somewhere where it will get a good deal of sunshine and have well-drained soil. To plant the basil in the garden, dig holes spaced at least 6 inches apart. Place the roots in the holes and place soil around the stems. Pat down soil around the plants to eliminate air pockets. If you want to plant the basil in a container, make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of plants you're growing; they need to be planted 6 inches apart, since they grow quite large. 2 Keep the soil damp, but not soaked. Basil does best in well-drained soil, and should not be subjected to standing water. Water the mature basil plants once a day, in the morning, so the water has time to soak in and evaporate rather than sitting on the plants overnight. 3 Pinch off flower heads. When you see flower buds, pinch them and two pairs of leaves under them off. Flowers blooming create a hormone change which dramatically reduces the flavor of the leaves, as well as reducing the amount of foliage which grows. This is called\" bolting\" and is more likely to happen when there's extra sunshine. You'll notice that if you leave the flowers, the plant will become lanky and the leaves won't be as full or tasty. 4 Watch for pests and mold. Basil plants are attractive to Japanese beetles the best way to control these pests is to pick them off the plants by hand. If your plants show signs of mold growth, they may not be getting adequate sunlight, or they may be too close together. Weed out the smaller plants to give the larger ones more space. Method 3 of 3: Harvesting and Using Basil 1 Harvest and prune. As the plant matures, pinch off the top two pairs of leaves once a stalk reaches a reasonable height. If you look closely, at the base of every leaf are two tiny little leaves that will grow outwards if the stem growing between them is cut off. Cut close to those tiny leaves, but be sure not to damage them. Pinching encourages the plant's energy to be directed into its stronger stems and leaves. This helps the plants grow bushy. Don't pinch on the lower part of the stem, or the basil plants will grow tall and reedy. You want them to get bushy, so pinch from the top. 2 Enjoy the basil fresh. Rinse off the leaves and use the basil to make pesto or a Caprese salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese. 3 Store the basil in the refrigerator. You'll probably have more basil than you could possibly eat fresh, so plan on storing some in the fridge. Wash the leaves, dry them well, and wrap them in paper towels. Place them in a food storage container with an airtight lid. 4 Freeze the basil. Freezing the leaves whole doesn't work very well, but if you puree it first you can freeze it for months. Place the basil in a blender with a little water. Puree it until smooth, then put it in a food storage bag and freeze until you need it.", "human1": "This basil growing guide recommends varieties (Cinnamon, Lemon, Purple, African Blue or Thai Basil), planting seed in containers with perlite, vermiculite, peat and soil before transfering sprouts to bigger containers or a garden, watering each morning and removing flower buds before plants bolt, and finally using basil for salads and pesto and freezing basil puree."}, "GUM_whow_chicken": {"fulltext": "How to Hypnotize a Chicken Anyone who's spent a lot of time on a farm with chickens is probably familiar with this trick. Those who've never heard of this will be amazed to see a chicken lie perfectly still after these instructions are followed. Biologists think that fear causes this \"hypnosis,\" which may be an attempt to \"play dead\" to fool predators. Method One of Two: Hypnotizing a Chicken Hold the chicken down on a flat surface. Hold the chicken with one hand supporting the breast. Place it down so that its breast is carrying its weight and rests on the ground. Continue to hold its feet so the grand experiment can continue. You can place the chicken on its breast instead. Press gently down on its back, and gently move its legs back if it tries to stand up. Wiggle your finger. Hold the bird down gently with one hand. Put one finger on your other hand just in front of its beak tip, without touching it. Move the finger backward to about 4 inches (10 cm) away, then back again. Repeat until the chicken stops moving or squawking. Let go of its legs. The chicken should be \"hypnotized\" and cease to struggle. It will lie there for anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes. Draw a line in front of its beak instead. If the chicken wasn't hypnotized, try this alternative. Using chalk, a stick, or your finger, draw a line on the ground 12 \" (30 cm) long. Start near the chicken's beak and draw the line slowly outward, in front of its head. Wake it up by clapping. Be nice to your feathered friend and let it get back to its business. Clap your hands or give it a gentle shove until it jumps up and walks away. Method Two of Two: Reducing Stress in the Chicken Understand the hypnotic effect. Researchers call this effect \"tonic immobility\". \"When a chicken or another animal with this tendency becomes frightened, its heart rate lowers and it stops moving. This may be an attempt to play dead, discouraging predators that prefer live prey. Unlike an opossum, the chicken gives an unconvincing act, as it continues to blink and breathe in an obvious way.\" Keep the chicken upright or on its side. While it's not uncommon to transport a chicken by its feet, this upside-down hold risks breaking the chicken's hip. Hypnosis techniques that involve laying a chicken on its back may \"succeed\" by cutting off its air supply. This can cause the chicken significant discomfort, leading to fainting or even, rarely, death. Keep hypnosis short and infrequent. It's not completely clear how much stress this hypnosis causes. Even if it does, the chicken shouldn't suffer as long as you let it go soon afterward. Hours of stress, or regular exposure to stressful situations, can cause serious health problems. Get your chickens used to humans and novelty. Even prolonged eye contact seems to have an effect. Living in stimulating environments with new objects may also help. Hens raise in battery cages stay \"hypnotized\" longer, possibly because of greater fear. Watch for signs of stress. Abnormal feathering, constant preening, or delays in egg-laying are all signs of a stressed chicken.

Ingredients Method 1: Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes: Servings: 18 - 24 (fewer if you opt for larger-sized cupcakes) 1 tablespoon (15 ml) apple cider vinegar 1 1/2 cups (350 ml) plain soy milk 2 3/4 cups (345 g) self raising flour 2 teaspoons (10 g) baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 cup (200 g) sugar 1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Vegan icing of your choice Method 2: Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes: Makes approx: 20 - 24 cupcakes: 275 g (2 cups) plain or all-purpose flour (sifted) 100 g (3/4 cup) quality cocoa powder (sifted) 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder Pinch of salt 450 ml (1 - 3/4 cup) unsweetened soy milk 2 teaspoons red wine or apple cider vinegar 320 g (1-2/3 cups) caster/superfine sugar 320 ml (1 - 1/4 cups) sunflower oil (or coconut oil) 2 tablespoons vanilla extract/essence Method 1 of 2: Basic Vanilla Vegan Cupcakes. Preheat the oven to 180oC/350oF. Prepare the muffin tray by adding cupcake holders/cases. Put to one side. Alternatively, use a silicone cupcake baking sheet with molded holes. Put the cider vinegar into a small bowl and add the soy milk. Stir this well and then put to one side. The mixture will now curdle and this is what should be happening. Stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. If you want chocolate cupcakes, add cocoa (about 1/2 cup) to this stage. Stir the oil and vanilla extract into the bowl containing the soy milk and vinegar. Mix together. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and beat together (by hand or with an electric hand-held mixer). Fill the muffin pan. Usually fill each paper cupcake holder with about 1/4 cup of batter. If you prefer larger cupcakes, then add a half a cup but make sure the muffin pan is larger and the cupcake holders are bigger. Bake for 18 - 20 minutes. If you can smell the cupcakes earlier, check to make sure they aren't browning earlier (this means they're more than ready). If you aren't certain, turn off the oven earlier and let them sit for a few more minutes rather than bake them into rocks. Wait for the pan to cool down. Place cupcakes onto a wire rack to cool. Ice the cupcakes. The flavor of icing or frosting can be improved by adding a little of your favorite juice to it instead of soy milk or water. Finished. Method 2 of 2: Basic Chocolate Vegan Cupcakes Preheat the oven to 160oC/315oF. If using cupcake cases, arrange on a baking sheet now. If using a silicone cupcake sheet, simply have it ready. Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and pinch of salt to the mixing bowl. Mix to combine. Pour the soy milk, vinegar, sugar, oil and vanilla into another bowl. Whisk together well. Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture. Stir to combine thoroughly. Pour into the cupcake cases or cupcake holes. Place into the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. If they smell strongly earlier, test with a wooden skewer; if it returns clean after sticking into a cupcake, they're ready. Remove from the oven. Transfer the cupcakes to a wire cooling rack as quickly as possible when cool enough to handle. Let cool completely on the rack. Frost as desired. Add standard frosting or make vegan butter cream. Tips You can add pureed fruit for delicious flavor changes. One small container of pureed fruit is sufficient for flavoring (the little containers that children take to school in their lunchboxes.) Try strawberry, apple, banana, apricot, peach etc. The cupcakes will not be as light and fluffy, however, so be prepared for a heavier cupcake if you add fruit but the added moisture content is a definite plus. Instead of using vegan sugar, you can replace it with equal parts maple sugar or rice syrup Instead of using vegetable oil, try substituting it for walnut or macadamia nut oils if they are available to you. Coconut oil also produces good results. And olive oil works fine if it's all that's left in the pantry. You can replace the plain soy milk with other flavors like chocolate or vanilla if you want to experiment with changing the flavor of the cupcakes.

It\u2019s easy to annoy people when you are cramped in such a small, tight space. Because elevator rides usually last less than a minute, make sure your pranks are quick and have a lot of punch. When annoying people on an elevator, keep your pranks lighthearted and fun as opposed to mean-spirited so that everyone leaving the elevator will have a pleasant story to tell. Method 1 Using the Elevator to Annoy People Push all the buttons. When you get into the elevator, push the button for every floor. This makes everyone\u2019s ride on the elevator longer, if only for a few seconds. If you want to take it a step further, look around questioningly at everyone in the elevator when no one gets off at the floors you pushed. [1] When someone comes in, say, \"I've got this,\" before you push all of the buttons. You can also push all the buttons as you reach the floor you are getting off at. If someone asks you why you pushed all the buttons, you can honestly say, \"It was just a joke!\" Make a dinging noise at each floor. Every time the elevator reaches a new floor, say \u201cding!\u201d very loudly. You can even sing the word \u201cding\u201d on each floor like notes in a scale, getting higher as you reach each new floor. [2] You can make other noises if you prefer, such as a bird cawing or an explosion sound every time a button is pushed. Talk to your reflection in the mirror. Many elevators have mirrors on the walls. A great way to be mischievous in an elevator is to carry on a running commentary while you look at yourself in the mirror. You could look at yourself, turning to catch different angles and say \u201cAll right, all right, now we\u2019re talking,\u201d very loudly. You could also keep adjusting your shirt or your hair, keeping a running dialogue about what look is best for you. Stand in the corner of the elevator facing the wall. Don't say anything the whole ride. Dance to the elevator music. Many elevators play music in the background, usually soft rock or smooth jazz. If you\u2019re in an elevator that is playing music, start to dance. Start just bobbing your head and tapping your feet, and then get your whole body into it. Take up as much space as you can to dance until everyone is staring at you. [3] Announce every floor. At every floor, make a loud announcement telling everyone the floor number. Say something like \u201cEveryone going to floor ten, get off now! No time to dilly dally!\u201d [4] You can also pretend to conduct people onto the elevator, saying \u201cAll aboard the elevator train!\u201d Exclaim that you've lost a beast. When the elevator is going from the bottom floor to the top, as soon as the doors close, exclaim that you lost your tarantula / snake / scorpion but confirm that it is somewhere in the elevator. Most people will probably see that this is a joke. However, if somebody looks seriously alarmed or is starting to panic, let them know that you were not being serious. Build in or add something to the elevator. For example, build a Lego city in the middle of the elevator. Lay a Twister mat on the floor and ask people if they want to play. Talk to people. When there are a lot of people, say, \"You're probably wondering why I've gathered you here today.\"", "human1": "This article suggests jokes and pranks to play on people in elevators, such as pushing all buttons, saying or singing 'ding' at every floor or announcing the floors, talking to your reflection in the mirror, standing in a corner facing the wall, dancing, putting a Lego city or Twister mat on the floor, or pretending to have lost a tarantula, snake or scorpion in the elevator."}, "GUM_whow_flirt": {"fulltext": "How to Flirt Through Instant Messaging So you want to flirt with a guy or gal on MSN, AIM, Facebook Chat, or any other instant messaging service and you don't want to look like a creep? Congratulations \u2014 by seeking help, you've already demonstrated more self-awareness than the vast majority of online flirts. See Step 1 below to start flirting smartly and respectfully. Part 1 of 2: Flirting Dos Start the conversation casually. As in the real world, the first step to flirting is to get over your cold feet and jump right in! Text the other person a brief message asking them about their day, asking them a specific question about work or school, or simply saying \"Hi!\". The hardest part of flirting is to break through your initial reluctance, so if you're having a hard time taking the plunge, just remind yourself that no matter how badly it goes, it'll be less stressful than an equivalent real-world encounter. There's no reason to be nervous when it comes to IM flirting \u2014 if the person you want to talk to doesn't want to talk to you, s/he always has the option of simply not responding to your message, as, from your point of view, this is indistinguishable from him or her simply being away from the computer. This being said, if you barely know someone, it can be a good idea to have an excuse for starting a conversation to avoid awkwardness. Asking for help with a work or school-related problem is almost always a good bet, as is asking a question about something striking about the person. For instance, if the person has a band-related username, you might say: \"Hey, cool name. Did you see those guys when they last came to town?\" Start small talk. After your initial greeting and exchange of pleasantries, you'll probably want to ask how the person's doing (just like you might in the real world). Ask him or her about work or school, his / her interests, or any recent trips, for instance. Rather than asking a question, you can also simply offer your comments on these things. When s/he responds, add your own comments or ask follow-up questions and proceed from there! Don't pry into his or her personal life \u2014 keep things light, fun, and focused on worry-free subjects. Don't dwell too long on small talk. A minute or two is great for breaking the ice, but much more can get boring fast. For example, after we've opened up by asking about this person's interest in the band in his / her username, it's logical and reasonable to ask about this person's musical likes and dislikes. You can even offer your own opinions and suggestions. For instance, you might say something like: \"If you like those guys, you might want to check out this band called Manic Albatross - they're like the Beatles, only darker. What sorts of other bands do you like?\" Joke. Everyone likes a good sense of humor. In the immortal words of Marilyn Monroe, \"If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything\" (don't worry, ladies \u2014 the same is true for men!) Try to be playful and even slightly sarcastic as you respond to the statements of the person you're talking to. For instance, if you're asked what you're up to, rather than saying, \"looking for people to hit on on Facebook\" you might find that it's a better idea to give a sarcastic answer like \"writing the great American novel\" or \"drowning my sorrows\". These responses have the added benefit of being natural launching points for conversations about your hobbies, like the writing you're doing on the side and the great bourbon you tasted the other day. In our example conversation, you might work a joke or two into your music-related small talk. For instance, you might say something like, \"I don't know why every song on the radio nowadays has a Texas Flynn feature. Does he even have time to record between rehab stints?\" Part 2 of 2: Flirting Don'ts Don't be too self-deprecating. Simply put, confidence is sexy. This is more true for real-life situations than it is online, but this mantra has some truth in the world of IM flirting as well. For instance, you'll want to avoid making lots of jokes at your own expense. Just one is plenty \u2014 it shouldn't be a recurring theme throughout your conversation. Doing this too often can quickly turn an otherwise flirtatious conversation into one in which you appear needy and self-loathing. On the other hand, this isn't to say that you should necessarily make jokes at other people's expense, as this can make you seem mean and petty. Any sort of pointed or caustic remarks about yourself or someone else don't have a place in flirtatious conversations. Don't be too sappy. People like flirting to be fun. For most people, receiving compliments is only fun up to a point \u2014 getting more than one or two can make someone feel embarrassed and self-conscious. It can also make him or her question your motives, leading the person to believe that you may be trying to get something out of him or her. Besides, the wooing power of flowery, gushing compliments is diminished (to say the least) when the compliments are displayed in a tiny box at the bottom of the screen alongside cartoon smiley faces. Instead of relying too heavily on compliments, instead, focus on having an engaging, genuine conversation. Follow the mantra \"show, don't tell.\" In other words, show that you're attracted to this person by giving him or her a great conversation, not by stating it outright.", "human1": "This guide to flirting via instant messaging suggests starting bu saying 'hi' and asking about someone's day, asking for help with work or school, or asking about their username, then moving on to musical likes and dislikes and making jokes, while avoiding self-deprecation, sappiness, excessive flattery or jokes at other people's expense."}, "GUM_whow_glowstick": {"fulltext": "How to Make a Glowstick Those glowing Mountain Dew videos with peroxide and baking soda are all hoaxes. To truly make a glowstick without breaking an already-made glowstick and shoving its contents into a tube (also known as cheating), you've gotta let your inner scientist out (along with a few dollars). If you're still curious, read on. This is fun for anyone and everyone. Method One of Two: Using Luminol Put on protective glasses. In addition, wear gloves to protect your skin. It's also a good idea to not wear your Sunday best. Throw on some old clothes or put a smock over clothes you want protected. Some of this stuff is dangerous -- this experiment is not meant for children! Listen up, kids: You'll be working with a solution that's near a 12 on the pH scale. That basically means don't swallow it, don't put it in your eyes, don't bathe in it, and don't really expose yourself to it directly at all. Got it? Moving on. Combine 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide and a liter of distilled water in a mixing bowl. A ceramic bowl will work best, but plastic works too. Use funnels, measuring tubes, and basters to keep everything well-measured and well away from you. Hydrogen peroxide is used to replace the luminol's nitrogen atoms with oxygen. When that happens, all the substances create a rave and start partying and electrons fly everywhere and what results? The glow. Mix .2 grams of luminol, 4 grams of sodium carbonate, .4 grams of copper sulfate, .5 grams of ammonium carbonate and 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of distilled water in a second bowl. It is important not to touch the luminol. Use a funnel to make everything safe and easy. Unfortunately, these hazardous chemicals will not float freely in mid-air like this graphic suggests. Yep, unless you're a coroner or some sort of crazy spy / criminologist you probably don't have this stuff lying around the house (hopefully not ...). If you're dead set on starting your own glowstick business (worse ideas exist), try websites like Alfa Aesar [1] or Sigma Aldrich [2] for supplies. Mix everything well. Don't use your hands -- use a metal or plastic utensil of some sort. Clean the containers and dry them thoroughly. It's important to use sanitary, clean tubes for your glowsticks. The last thing you want is other substances interacting with the reactions you're depending on to make the substances glow. Set the correct lid next to each container. This enables you to seal the containers quickly after filling. It's not like the glow will get up and run away from you, but still. Combine equal amounts of the first and second solution in the container and close the bottles. Shake them up once the lids are on tightly. Then turn off the lights! If it's not already glowing, something went wrong. Do over! Watch as the chemical compound creates a colorful glow. Take your glowsticks to the party and charge your friends loads of money for them! But act quickly ... the glow won't last very long. Expectations crushed? Method two to the rescue! The reaction that the luminol and hydrogen peroxide creates doesn't last long at all -- maybe a couple of minutes. For something that lasts hours, go to the next method (which is a lot easier to facilitate if you have access to a laboratory, but it's still worth mentioning).", "human1": "This guide to making a glowstick suggests using protective clothing and mixing hydrogen peroxide and water in one bowl, then luminol, sodium carbonate, copper sulfate, ammonium carbonate (available from websites such as Alfa Aesar or Sigma Aldrich) and water in another, and finally mixing some of both solutions in a bottle to create the glow."}, "GUM_whow_joke": {"fulltext": "How to Tell a Joke Two Parts: Getting the Material Right Getting the Delivery Right From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends, a good joke pleases everyone. Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension, make a new friend, or light up a room. That is, of course, if you can get a laugh. Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people, but for others it takes practice and hard work. Part 1 of 2: Getting the Material Right Know your audience. All aspects of the joke you tell, from the content to the length, need to be suited to your audience. What\u2019s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old-uncle laugh (then again, maybe not). Everyone\u2019s an individual, so there are no hard and fast rules. But, unless you personally know the members of your audience, here are some good rules of thumb to follow: elderly people won\u2019t like crude jokes; stay away from misogynist jokes if you\u2019ve got an audience full of women; people of a specific ethnic or racial group won\u2019t enjoy jokes making fun of their group; and jokes requiring specialized knowledge (of, for example, science or old movies) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge. The more you know about your audience the better you\u2019ll be able to tailor your jokes to them. Choose great material. You can find fodder lots of places \u2014 from your life, joke files online, by repurposing jokes you\u2019ve heard in the past, and so on. You may want to start your own joke file. You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer. [1] The latter option may allow for easier revision. Decide on a target. Every joke has a \u201ctarget,\u201d which is what the joke is about. It\u2019s important that the joke\u2019s target (the most basic element of your material) be suited to your audience. Make sure it\u2019s a target your audience will be interested in and something they\u2019re likely willing to laugh at. [2] For example, husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa; students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous. Have a realistic but exaggerated setup. The opening of the joke \u2014 or setup \u2014 should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it, but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge. [3] Think of the setup as the foundation of a story. It\u2019s a fundamental part of the joke; if you don\u2019t lay a good foundation here, then the punchline won\u2019t make sense to the audience or they won\u2019t find it humorous. Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny \u2014 it\u2019s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny. [4] The exaggeration can be slight or considerable \u2014 it just depends on the individual joke. Surprise with the punchline. The ending of the joke is obviously crucial. This is where the payoff comes in, what makes the joke succeed or fail. If you want to make the audience laugh, your punchline needs to be surprising. Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper, which is an additional punchline. The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way. Make the joke your own. Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told. For your joke to be funny, it has to surprise the audience in some way, which means it has to seem original or new. One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending. [5] Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life. This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable. It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s). [6] Know your material. Practicing your joke is crucial. You don\u2019t need to have it completely memorized \u2014 in fact, you \"shouldn\u2019t\" memorize it \u2014 but you need to be really comfortable with it, so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked, which is very possible once you\u2019re in front of an audience. Memorized jokes sound wooden, like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer. Good jokes have a lot of details and personality, so don\u2019t be afraid to embellish. [7] Try different things out and see what feels right, what sounds best. Don\u2019t use a joke until you\u2019re completely comfortable with it. Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself. If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or \u201cah\u201ds or \u201cum\u201ds, your joke isn\u2019t ready and you need to practice more. [8] You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you\u2019re ready for a \u201creal\u201d audience.", "human1": "This section from a guide on how to tell a joke advises practicing but not memorizing jokes, knowing your audience to pick appropriate jokes, choosing material from your life, online or repurposing jokes you've heard, using a realistic but exaggerated setup your audience can relate to, followed by a surprising punchline and possibly an additional 'topper' punchline."}, "GUM_whow_languages": {"fulltext": "Method 2 of 2: Using Grammar Name your language. This is the most fundamental property in all languages. You have many names to choose from. You can even use a made up word from your made up language like 'Victory' or 'Great Language'. The choice is all yours. Start off with the highly frequently used words such as 'and' or 'I' or 'one' or 'the'. It is recommend that you use short words since they are commonly used. An example would be 'ant' for and or 'es' or even 'loo' for the word 'and'. Start thinking about the grammar rules. For example if the word Bird is 'Vogelaviatiolap' then why not make the word Birds 'Vogelaviatiolaps' since the suffix 's' is added at the end for most languages at plurals. If you want to add complication, you can add genders like most European languages like French and German. For example, if you want the word 'horse' to be a boy, you may want 'the horse' to be 'Mat Fereder', but a 'cat' to be a girl, you may want, 'the cat' to be 'Fet Kamaow'. Consider basing your language on an existing language. For example, in my made up language, 'Vogelaviatiolap' means Bird. If you haven't guessed, it comes from the following: 'Vogel' comes from German, which means bird 'aviatio' comes from English. It's uncompleted though, because the word is part of the term 'aviation' 'lap' comes from Onomatopoeia. It's a completed term, but it is supposed to come from 'Flap!' Consider basing some of your words from other words you have invented. For example, if you invented the word 'China' as 'Khinssa', 'Drink' as 'Bever', and the word 'Accident' as 'Casnondelibreaten', why not make the word 'tea' as 'Khincasnonbever' or 'Bevernondelibreatekin' or even 'Khinssacasnondelibreatenibever'! Get inspiration from existing alphabets and words. Why not add some non Latin Characters such as \u00df? You can even make the whole language not based on the Latin Alphabet at all like Chinese! You can even take some words of languages, altering them or not. You can make the word 'pen' as 'penn' or even 'pen'. Using the dictionary can ensure you not missing a single word. Keep track of all your Remember to write down your creations! Use your language. Get used to using it yourself, and spread it to others. Once you feel confident about your language, experiment and expand: Grab a book / novel and translate it to your own language. Teach your friends this new language. As soon as your friends understand your language, communicate to them with it. Be fluent in your own made up language and start spreading this to your friends, family and strangers! Write your own poem / novel / story with your own made up language. If you're really ambitious, set a goal of helping others become fluent in the language. One day, maybe you can make it the official language of a country! Tips Make sure that it is a language that while speaking, you don't get a literal knot in your tongue! Remember you should know how to write it. For example we write it from left to right, in Arabic it's right to left, Chinese is in columns, and so on. Make sure that you and your friend(s) all follow a systematic language system. In other words, make sure that you follow the same guidelines. Don't use random letters. It should make some sense, so that it will be easier to learn and speak with [Example: Don't use oh as e, hello as llo, and See ya as c yah). Make sure you practice saying and spelling out many basic words in your language, English examples: is, who, when, of, why, if, what, where, can, may, etc. When starting off, follow closely to a language you like. This will make grammar much easier to make. You must avoid simply copying the grammar rules, however, as this would technically turn your language into a code. Practice your language frequently so that you don't forget it! Don't forget punctuation! As a shortcut, and for a bit of interesting background, add connotation to various letters, preferably vowels. To do this, think of various words that begin with / have a lot of a certain vowel. For example: austere, acrimony, ebullient, embolden; in this case, the vowel A might carry with it a negative meaning, whereas E would be positive. Then, even if you forget your own words without the help of your dictionary, you could still make a good guess based on the composition of the letters. Try not to make your words sound like utter and complete gibberish just add a little extra than our regular English language. We don't want a knot in your tongue after speaking to your friends. Just put marks over the letters or make up something right on the spot, you might have to take some time on this! Basing letters on objects (pictographs) is an easy way to start a writing system. Try this with a group of friends. It's much more fun when there are other people that can understand your language. Email or text your friends the language so that they won't be so confused. When making a writing system, take a break about every five minutes and come back to it or all your letters will begin to look identical. If you want to make other languages, you can use this language as a model and change some letters or sounds to create a different language.

The straps on adults\u2019 overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead. Your appliances are also murder on the straps, which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls. This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear, extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed. Steps Wash alone or with \"like\" clothing. It\u2019s best to wash adults\u2019 overalls alone, especially men\u2019s. However, it is okay to wash just a few items with them, like blue jeans. What you don\u2019t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps, like women\u2019s long sleeve shirts or kids\u2019 blankets. Think similar clothing, minus the twisty-ness. Just do the denim and canvas stuff together. Fasten the straps to the bib. If you didn\u2019t know already, the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets. Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash. This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash. Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened. This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run. Don\u2019t skip it. Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they don\u2019t come loose. If your washing machine is worth its salt, it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it. All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience. Empty the pockets. Overalls have more pockets than pants. The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket. Kids put rocks, candy, and bugs in these. Men put cell phones and small tools in them. Women defy the laws of purse-space, so when it comes to bib pockets, the sky is the limit. Make sure all the pockets are empty. Move the strap adjusters around. You\u2019ve probably got them just the way you like them, but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally, the straps will last longer. Depending on the adjusters, you may be able to leave them a little loose too. The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles (not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes). Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing. This is the same idea as rotating tires. You know about rotating your tires, don't you? Tips If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load, use about half the detergent called for and less water. Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer.

Steps Pack one room at a time if possible, and start with items that are least often used. Write down a list of everything you are packing, in particular if it's valuable. Books, CDs, expensive clothes. Also, take note of which item is in which box. Use sturdy boxes. Fill the box to the brim and seal the lid. That way, you can easily stack boxes on top of one another. Tape the bottom of the box securely so that it doesn't give way. Never fill a box until it is so heavy that you can't lift it safely. Spread the heavy items over a few boxes. Balance boxes with lighter items like towels or soft toys. Pack the lighter items on top. Use bubble wrap or newspapers when packing fragile items. However, newsprint may smudge so use newspaper selectively. Clean paper can be purchased cheaply from moving supply stores. Mark boxes. Boxes should be marked \"Fragile\" and \"This side up\" to prevent mishandling. Label each box clearly and which room it belongs to. Write on the sides of the box as well. Pack a separate box of essentials you may need for the first night at your new house. Include items like toiletries, toilet paper, bottled water, snacks and a change of clothes in case you can not unpack everything in time. Tips Don't label boxes with contents if the contents are valuable. Instead of writing \"Silver Service - Fragile\" you should write something that makes it sound less theft inviting while showing the fragile nature of the contents. Example: \"Mom's old dishes\" instead of \"Fine China\" Tape is cheap. Use lots of it. Close box bottoms well. Get masking tape or packing tape and tape screws and other little things that came out of something back against it. You'll want to find the right screw reassemble something without having to pick it out of 100 others when you get there. Don't pack one box full of books or paperwork - you might not be able to carry it at all. Fill it halfway with books, and fill it up with lighter stuff. National superstores (Walmart) will let you walk the store for boxes when they are stocking the stores between 11 pm and 1 am. You can find boxes of all sizes. Cereal, diaper and houseware boxes are a good size and durable. Just take a cart and roam the store. They do check the cart as you leave so don't try to sneak anything past them. U-haul and other nation companies offer box buy back services. If you buy too many boxes you can return the unused for a full refund. These boxes are also quite sturdy so you can re-use them or stash in your attic until you move again. Some national companies even offer free shipping and handling so you can have some delivered or go to the local location. Fill empty spaces with additional paper. Throw away or donate junk you don't want to take to your new place. Don't pack it again!!! Set aside an area of the house where you can put all the packed boxes. Use a room that isn't used every day such as the formal dining or living room. You won't be tripping over boxes and you can have a better idea of what you have and where things are. Pack books and heavy items into smaller boxes. Digital Photos - use your camera to document the contents of boxes.", "human1": "This moving guide recommends packing each room, labeling and photographing what is in each box, filling sturdy boxes to the brim to allow for stacking, balancing heavy and light items so boxes can be lifted, marking fragile boxes and using bubble wrap or newspapers, getting free boxes from superstores (Walmart) and selling back boxes to U-haul."}, "GUM_whow_parachute": {"fulltext": "How to Cope With a Double Parachute Failure While skydiving, it is possible (yet extremely unlikely) that both your primary and reserve parachutes will malfunction, leaving you with no method of reducing your velocity. In the vast majority of cases, this will not occur; nevertheless, in this event these coping strategies may assist. Steps Remain calm. This may seem obvious, but deep, even breathing (despite the rushing slipstream) and controlling your heart-rate are essential to your continued survival. Entreat assistance. If both your primary and reserve chutes have malfunctioned, signal immediately to a fellow jumper who has not yet deployed their chute, waving your arms and signalling that your own is not functional. If this is a solo jump, then skip to step 6. Prepare for deployment. After linking arms with your fellow jumper, you will need to hook your arms through their chest strap, or through both sides of the front of their harness, as far as you can, then grab onto your own strap. Deploy. The shock of the chute deployment will be intense. The G-forces will multiply your body weight, making it impossible to hold on; this is why hooking your arms through the harness is essential. It is likely that the shock will dislocate or break both your arms; nevertheless this is a small price to pay for your life. Prepare for impact. If your companion's canopy has successfully opened, then both your chances of survival have dramatically increased. With a large and slow canopy, your chances are even better. The canopy must be steered away from power lines and similar obstructions; try for a large body of water if you are confident your companion can save you from drowning. Alternative: Lack of companions If this is a solo jump, which constitutes the minority of skydivers, your only recourse is to ensure that at least one of your own chutes opens. In this case, the excellent advice offered by your instructors on assisting chute opening may be of assistance to you. If it becomes apparent that you cannot open either of your two parachutes, or that for some other reason they are fatally non-functional, then the following steps may be of some minor assistance. Appeal. If you are of a religious turn of mind, you may wish at this point to offer a prayer to a god, goddess, protective spirit or guardian angel. St Jude, the patron saint of Lost Causes, comes to mind. Objectively, this is not likely to help very much; but it may improve your emotional state. If you do not have any religious beliefs, or are for another reason unwilling to appeal to your patron deity, skip this step. Contemplate. As you approach the Earth at, or close to, terminal velocity, you may wish to contemplate your past existence, and the possibility of a future afterlife. A strategy that might prove helpful is to consider how fortunate you are that life has been good to you so far. Alternatively, if life has not been good to you so far, (and considering your current situation this seems more likely) consider how lucky you are that it will not be troubling you much longer. Expect impact. You are unlikely to have the time or ability to aim for a soft landing-spot, body of water, or other impact site that might improve your chances of survival. There is a minuscule chance that your impact will result in non-life-threatening injuries; if this seems incredibly far-fetched, comfort yourself that double chute failure in modern times is also extremely unlikely, and that you have already beaten worse odds. Tips Your reserve chute should have been packed by a certified rigger and is moderately less likely to fail; therefore, it may be helpful to focus your efforts on opening your reserve parachute. Some humans who have, for various reasons, become aware of their impending death, develop psychological coping strategies to deal with this; for instance, the Kubler-Ross phases of grief. Since your own death approaches far more quickly, this is unlikely to be of any use to you. Warnings Water landings: if you have successfully attached to a companion whose chute opens, keep in mind that both your arms may be broken or dislocated, and you may be unable to swim or tread water before your chute fills and drags you under. If, after total chute failure, you land on something soft, it is possible that instead of being killed outright, you may be permanently paralyzed due to spinal injury. If you have a strong aversion to this outcome, aiming head-downward before impact in the manner of an Olympic diver may ensure the destruction of your cranium and your immediate demise.", "human1": "This double parachute failure guide advises remaining calm, alerting fellow jumpers by waving your arms and linking arms with them through their harness, prepare for chute deployment shock and impact and steering away from powerlines and towards water (or in a solo jump, attempting to open the reserve chute or else praying)."}, "GUM_whow_procrastinating": {"fulltext": "How to Stop Procrastinating If you're a chronic procrastinator, you know the pain and stress that comes with putting things off. Although you may have the desire to accomplish something, getting the motivation to do it is a different matter. Fortunately, overcoming your procrastination is easy to do when you put your mind to it. Side note: If you have anything due right now, and you haven't finished it, leave this article and complete that work. Steps Create a to-do list. Yes, make yourself an old fashioned to-do list with check boxes and everything. List everything, big and small, that you have to do for your entire day; break big activities into smaller bits if necessary. Then, as you work through your day, check off each of the items on your list. You will feel a growing sense of pride as you visually monitor your ever-diminishing list of projects. Focus your list on including the things you typically put off, not the things you are sure to do on a regular basis. If necessary, set time-frames for your items to be done by. For example, list \u201ctake the dog for a walk by 12:30\u201d rather than simply \u201cwalk the dog.\u201d Re-evaluate your list halfway through your day to rank your items based on highest priority. Then, tackle the most important ones before looking back at the smaller things to do. Keep a notebook by hand before you start your workday. Write every thought down that comes up during work. Every single to do or things you want to do at that specific moment. Don't do it, put it on a list and do it later. This prevents you from getting into the \"procrastination zone.\" Finish the hard stuff. When you have a looming project that's bogging you down and making you unproductive in other areas, tackle it first. Finishing the largest item on your list of things to do will make you feel extra productive and give you the boost to do other things you\u2019ve been pushing to the side. If your \u201cbig project\u201d is something that can\u2019t be done in one sitting, make a list of small parts of it that you can accomplish today. Don\u2019t worry about completing the entire thing, but take steps now so that doing so in the future is a breeze. Make an ultimate to-do list for this single project, and have it placed somewhere you will see it on a regular basis. As you mark things off, you will be motivated to continue doing so, and seeing it on a regular basis will remind you that your project needs to be done. Do two-minute tasks. Whenever you are presented with something that you don\u2019t want to do or would consider putting off, ask yourself, \u201cwill this take me less than two minutes to finish?\u201d For many of us, this includes small chores, like taking out the trash or pulling a few weeds, but can include simple tasks in all areas of life. Anything that you want to put off but takes two minutes to do - do it. Simply force yourself to use the next 120 seconds to be productive and do the duty you normally would push off for hours or days. [1]. Create a timed work frenzy. If you find yourself being pulled off into the depths of daydreams, set a period of time to do nothing but work. Take ten minutes and remove all distractions - your phone, magazines, or thoughts of your attractive love - and go into a working frenzy. Force yourself to work productively for ten minutes, and then go back to whatever it was you were doing. Chances are, you\u2019ll get into a groove and keep working at a high pace even when your frenzy time is out. Working with a timer is generally regarded by most experts as being one of the best ways to develop self-discipline and stop procrastination. The most famous method of working to strict time controls (known as time-boxing) involves creating a list of tasks. Each task is then assigned an exact amount of time to complete. If you don't finish the task in the allotted time, then you move on to the next one. Using this work arrangement, it forces you to take action, as you can't afford to waste any time. [2]. Give yourself a break. If you can\u2019t seem to focus and are working half-heartedly at your tasks, give yourself a brief break. Set a timer for ten minutes, and take a nap, read a book, or call your friend. Do whatever it is you\u2019ve been daydreaming about so that the temptation is removed once you get back to work. Just be sure to follow through with your deadline rather than ignoring it when your alarm finally goes off.", "human1": "This guide on preventing procrastination recommends using a prioritized to-do list with time frames, placed where you can see it, finishing hard stuff first or breaking it down into small parts you can accomplish today, using a timer ('time-boxing') and doing two-minute tasks whenever possible, or doing productive ten-minute work frenzies and ten-minute breaks."}, "GUM_whow_quidditch": {"fulltext": "How to Play Muggle Quidditch In the Harry Potter series written by JK Rowling the main wizarding sport is Quidditch. However you don't have to have magical powers to play. There are many different ways of playing Quidditch, but the most commonly used set of rules are those given by the International Quidditch Association (which can be found here). In the past Muggle Quidditch has mainly been played at colleges in the US, but over the last few years there has been a dramatic rise in the number of community teams. Quidditch has also spread outside of America and is now played on 5 continents. Steps Gather all needed materials and players (see Things You'll Need section below). Know that all players can play while riding a broom. Brooms can be a hindrance however, so feel free to not use brooms. Place the quaffle and three bludgers in the middle of the field. Ideally the quaffle and bludgers should be slightly deflated so that they are easier to throw and catch. Start the game. Both teams start from the edges and attempt to obtain the quaffle and bludgers. Follow your duty depending what type of player you are: Chasers try to score by throwing the quaffle into one of the three goal hoops. Each score is worth 10 points. Beaters try to peg players with their bludger. If a player is pegged they have to stop what they're doing and pay a penalty; i.e. (drop the quaffle in the case of a chaser) and run back to and touch their goal post or alternatively sit down for 10 seconds. Keepers guard the goal posts at each end and attempt to block chasers' attempts at scoring. If Keeper is close to their hoops they are safe from being hit by bludgers. Seekers try to tackle the snitch (a person) or obtain an object attached to the snitch such as a sock or flag. You can establish you own rules as to how a player catches the snitch. A common way to play is to make the snitch a person, and give the snitch a head start to run and hide in defined boundaries. Then the seekers search for the snitch, and attempt to tag the player. Other methods, such as the method adopted in 2005, makes the snitch a tennis ball in a sock, hanging out of the running shorts of the snitch runner. Regardless of method, the winning seeker wins 30 points for his or her team, unlike the books, in which the snitch is worth 150 points. The creators of Muggle Quidditch thought that it was worth too many points so changed the value of the snitch for muggle Quidditch. The snitch, generally a track runner, runs around (usually the boundaries) trying to evade the seekers. The referee should ensure that rules are being followed. They also keep track of the score. Play the game! The object of the game is to score the most points and the game ends when the seeker snatches the snitch. Feel free to alter the game rules. See the Tips section for suggestions. Video How to Play a Real-Life Game of Quidditch You don't need flying broomsticks or magic balls to play this version of the game - it's tailor-made for muggles like us. This video shows a more realistic approach to playing Quidditch. Tips Alternatively the snitch can be a small yellow ball (tennis balls work great) that is hidden before the game starts by a bystander or referee. Establish boundaries and have the seekers look for the snitch. Beaters can try hitting the bludgers around in the air with a shortened hockey sticks or a short bat. They could also use regular-length hockey sticks to hit bludgers (perhaps wiffle balls) on the ground. The simplest way is to just peg players by throwing dodge balls. It may be easier to play without brooms (but also less fun!). Remember that the snitch runner, if you choose to use one, is not an actual player in the game, therefore, not bound by any of the rules. If desired, the snitch is able to do whatever he or she wants to avoid capture. See How to Be a Snitch in Quidditch for more information. You can play water quidditch in a pool. Almost all the same rules apply. Have someone throw something (the snitch) on a line into the pool at regular intervals. They can even use fake snitches. You can buy authentic looking brooms to make the game more realistic. There is a very large Quidditch community, have a look at the IQA website to find teams near you. One variation is Quarter Snitch Quidditch. Find a quarter or another small coin. Have both of the teams turn around and have the referee throw it into the grass or pitch while the teams aren't looking. Play while the seekers look for the snitch. Another variation is where the referee places the snitch somewhere in the field (in this case it's a small ball). The seeker has to find the snitch blindfolded, relying only on the coach's instructions, while the game is still on. Warnings Stay hydrated and exercise wisely. A ball flying in the air can hurt. If you're playing quidditch you're probably just having fun so play nicely.

The Incas treated the crop as sacred and referred to quinoa as \"chisaya mama\" or \"mother of all grains.\" [1] By tradition, the Inca emperor would sow the first seeds of the season using \"golden implements.\" Quinoa is rich in protein and much lighter than other grains. It is much easier to prepare than rice and is rapidly gaining in popularity, especially among vegetarians who value its high protein levels. Ingredients 1 cup quinoa 2 cups water (or broth) Olive oil to taste (Optional) 1/2 teaspoon salt (Optional) Method 1 Cooking On A Stove Top Rinse the grains of quinoa in water. You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box. To rinse, place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes. This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed. Toast quinoa in a saucepan (optional). Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute. This brings out quinoa's nutty flavor. Cook the quinoa. Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain. Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ, in the same way as pasta. Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat. Take the quinoa off the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan. Uncover and fluff with a fork. The quinoa should look light and fluffy, and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed. Serve. Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor. Serve with: Stir-fry, using the quinoa as a substitute for rice. Curry. Braised meat. In a salad. Virtually any other combination you can think of! Method 2 Cooking In a Rice Cooker Rinse 1 cup of quinoa in a fine mesh sieve under cold water. If you bought packaged quinoa, this step isn't always necessary, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Pour quinoa into rice cooker. One option is to toast the quinoa before placing in the rice cooker. See Step # 2 in Method One above for directions. Add 2 cups of liquid and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the rice cooker. Water, chicken stock or broth, or vegetable stock all work. Cook for approximately 15 minutes. Some rice cooker will have different settings instead of a simple \"cook\" option. Try the \"white rice\" option if your rice cooker gives you several options. Let stand for about 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve. Method 3 Cooking In the Oven Preheat oven to 350 \u00b0 F (177 \u00b0 C). Arrange rack in the middle of the oven. Rinse quinoa thoroughly in a fine mesh seive under cold water. In a medium saucepan, heat up 2 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium-low heat. Add onions, peppers, mushrooms, or any other type of desired vegetable or herb into the saucepan (optional). Cook onions until they are translucent, but not burned. Sweat the peppers or vegetables along with the onions. Add the quinoa and salt to the saucepan, stirring until completely incorporated. This should take no longer than 30 seconds. Add one cup of broth and one cup of water to the saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Once a boil is reached, transfer quinoa to a 8-by-8-inch baking dish. [2] Spread out quinoa evenly and cover baking dish completely with aluminum foil. Cook the quinoa in the oven for roughly 20 minutes, or until most of the liquid is gone.

All you need to do is place your favorite combination of Skittles candies into a glass or bottle of vodka and wait for it to infuse. You can then use your Skittles vodka to make brightly-colored cocktails or even serve it as a sugary shot! Find multiple methods for making Skittles vodka after the jump -- and soon you'll be tasting the rainbow! Ingredients A handle (1.75 liters, about a half gallon) of vodka per bag of Skittles A large bag of Skittles candy (the \"movie size\" bag) Method 1 of 3: Single Serving (25 mL Shot) Separate the colors of Skittles that you want to flavor the vodka with. Many people choose to leave out the green, which is lime if you're using original Skittles, and purple, which is grape in the original style, as they can create a weird taste combination or a less than appealing color for the final product. However, you can put them in if you want. If you don't mind mixed flavors, you can just skip this step altogether. Add six Skittles to 25 ml of vodka. Keep swirling the mixture until the Skittles are almost completely dissolved. Note that the ratio of Skittles to vodka varies from recipe to recipe. You should experiment to find your preferred mix before making larger bottles. Filter out the remaining Skittle \"insides\". With single servings like this, you can decide which flavor(s) you like best and proceed to making bottles, if you desire. Method 2 of 3: Bottles of \"Skittled\" Vodka Pour out some vodka from a bottle to make room for Skittles. Separate the Skittles by color. Add the Skittles (20 - 25 per 350 ml / 11.8 fl oz). Let the mixture sit for a day or two. Shake occasionally so the flavour mixes well. Strain out the Skittles using a filter, such as a paper coffee filter or a clean t-shirt. Refrigerate overnight. Method 3 of 3: Dishwasher Bottle Method Separate the colors from five bags of 200 g Skittles. Using 5 x 700 ml / 23.6 fl oz bottles, pour 300 ml / 10.1 fl oz of vodka into a jug and fill each bottle with skittles. Place the bottles in your dishwasher and put on an intensive cycle. One third of of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously. Two thirds of the way through the cycle, shake all bottles vigorously. Once the cycle has finished, shake all bottles vigorously again. Then place in the freezer for 2 hours. Once the vodka is cold, it should be syrupy. Take a sieve, line it with a piece of cheesecloth (muslin) or a coffee filter, place above a large jug and pour the vodka through slowly. Once the first bottle has been filtered, wash out the bottle and pour the Skittles vodka back in. Repeat the above two steps for all bottles, ensuring that everything is cleaned between uses to prevent color contamination. Place all of the bottles in the freezer until you are ready to drink. Don't worry, the vodka won't freeze. You are finished. Enjoy your tasty creation. Tips. If you want to make it more quickly, cut the skittles in half before putting them into vodka. Shake every 15 minutes. They'll dissolve in an hour instead of a day. Or you could just scoop them out when the color dissolves. Start with small amount of vodka and Skittles at first to experiment which combination of taste suits you best. You can carry this out with larger amount of vodka and Skittles once you have decided that you enjoy the taste. The lime green Skittles add a sourness to the drink, so if you want one that's sweet, leave the green ones out and add them to their own bottle for a sour lime vodka. Another approach is to buy five bottles of vodka and five bags of Skittles. Then separate the candy and use one flavor for each bottle. (Or get four bottles and an empty, to allow room for the skittles.) If using a t-shirt to strain, be sure fabric softener or a dryer sheet had not been used with it, lets you get some extra (unwanted) flavoring (and potentially toxic chemicals).

Personal experiences of discrimination and bias have been the focus of much social science research. [1 - 3] Sociologists have explored the adverse consequences of discrimination [3 \u2013 5]; psychologists have examined the mental processes that underpin conscious and unconscious biases [6]; neuroscientists have examined the neurobiological underpinnings of discrimination [7 \u2013 9]; and evolutionary theorists have explored the various ways that in-group / out-group biases emerged across the history of our species. [10] In many respects, researchers already possess a wealth of knowledge concerning the origins and consequences of discrimination and bias. [11] What also should not be lost in discussion of discrimination is the growing push to implement social policy aimed at reducing the occurrence of discriminatory practices. Mandatory diversity trainings in professional settings, for example, are intended to reduce bias in the workplace by increasing the awareness of employees regarding the challenges facing minority group members. [12] Indeed, the implementation of certain policies is rooted in the assumption that discrimination and biases are, at least to some appreciable amount, present in modern society. Even so, estimates of the prevalence of perceived discrimination remains rare (see [13 \u2013 14]). At least one prior study by Kessler and colleagues [15], however, using measures of perceived discrimination in a large American sample, reported that approximately 33% of respondents reported some form of discrimination (see also, Gibbons et al. [4]). The current study seeks to build on this research by estimating the prevalence of discrimination experiences among a large, nationally representative sample of adults from the United States. Additionally, the analysis address the perceived reasons for reported discrimination experiences. Reason for discrimination. All respondents who indicated they were discriminated against \u2014 specifically, those who responded with sometimes or often to the perceived discrimination measure described above \u2014 were asked the following question: \u201cWhat do you think was the main reason for these experiences?\u201d Respondents were allowed to choose one response from 11 categories. For the present analysis, these responses were recoded into nine mutually exclusive categories capturing the following options: race / ancestry / skin color; gender; age; religion; height or weight; sexual orientation; education or income; physical disability; and other. The following categories from the original questionnaire were collapsed into one category for the analysis: race; ancestry or national origin; and shade of skin color. Additionally, because this question was only asked of respondents who reported prior discrimination experiences, the built-in skip pattern resulted in a large number of cases scored as missing (legitimate skip). Respondent race. Because a race variable is not available from the Wave 4 interviews, we use the racial category reported by the respondent during the Wave 1 interview. Wave 1 race \u2014 rather than, say, Wave 3 race \u2014 was used to preserve case counts. The logic is that (nearly) all Wave 4 respondents appeared in the Wave 1 sample, but not all would have been interviewed at Wave 3 due to differential patterns of temporary attrition. Respondents were asked to indicate their race from among the following categories: White; Black or African American; Hispanic; American Indian or Native American; and Asian or Pacific Islander. Respondents were provided the opportunity to select more than one race, and those who did were asked a follow-up question regarding which category best described their racial background. In the current study, those respondents who indicated more than one race were coded as \u201cmixed race\u201d. Demographic variables. To provide information on the analytical sample as a whole, two additional demographic variables are included. First, age is a continuous measure created by subtracting the year of the respondents' birth (obtained from Wave 1) from the year of the interview at Wave 4. Second, sex was dichotomously coded based on the self-reported sex of the respondent at Wave 4 (0 Analytical plan. Our exploratory study included three basic steps. First, summary statistics of the study variables and racial categories were produced. Second, we examined the relative proportions of the two discrimination experience measures across each racial category. Finally, we assessed the distribution of reported reasons for discrimination across the racial categories. In order to examine potential bivariate associations, the adjusted F statistic (design-based F) was employed as it corrects for a complex sample design such as that used in the Add Health. [21] More specifically, when analyzing weighted sample data employing the svy suite of commands in Stata the conventional Pearson \u03c72 statistic test of independence is converted into \u201can Fstatistic with noninteger degrees of freedom by using a second-order Rao and Scott (1981 [22], 1984 [23]) correction\u201d. [24] The p-value associated with the design-based F is thus more accurate (than the associated with the \u03c72 statistic) given the adjustments and calculations take into account the weighted nature of the data.

GUJJOLAAY EEGIMAA, ITS SPEAKERS AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS This section briefly presents the G\u00fajjolaay Eegimaa (Eegimaa for short; Ethnologue code: ISO 639-3: bqj), its speakers and its varieties. We also discuss aspects of the contact situation of the Eegimaa language. This is important, because as we will show in \u00a7 6 below, some of the Eegimaa death prevention names and child-bearing names are given to Eegimaa people from other communities. Eegimaa is a J\u00f3ola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal by a population estimated to be between 7,000 (Bass\u00e8ne, 2007) and 11,200 speakers (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2014). J\u00f3ola languages are classified as members of Sapir\u2019s (1971) BAK group of Atlantic languages of the Niger Congo language phylum. Speakers of these languages are found in the Gambia, in the former Casamance region of Southern Senegal and in Guinea Bissau. The map in Figure 1, taken from Ethnologue, presents the languages of Senegal. The arrow on the map points to the Eegimaa speaking area (Bandial is the name used by Ethnologue for Eegimaa). Eegimaa is mainly spoken in Mof-\u00c1vvi, a former kingdom of 10 villages located to the west of Ziguinchor, the capital city of the former administrative region of Casamance in the south of Senegal. Mof-\u00c1vvi is a peninsula bordered by the Casamance River to the north, which separates it from the J\u00f3ola B\u00faluf and J\u00f3ola Fogny areas, and to the east by the villages Brin and Djibonker, where the speakers of Kujireray and Ba\u00efnounk Gub\u00ebeher live. In the south, the river known as Kamobeul Bolon separates Mof-\u00c1vvi from the Bayot speaking area, while the west side of Mof-\u00c1vvi coincides with the homeland of the J\u00f3ola Kaasa H\u00faluf and J\u00f3ola Kaasa \u00c9suulaalu\u0294. The map in Figure 2 below, adapted from Palmeri and Gazio (1995), shows a very approximate location of Mof-\u00c1vvi in relation to other neighbouring speech communities. Some of these communities will be referred to in our discussion of death prevention names in \u00a7 6. The Eegimaa spoken in Mof-\u00c1vvi is known by several names given by speakers of neighbouring languages. For example, the name Kusiilay 1 \u2018the language of Essil\u2019, is the name given by speakers of Kujireray to the Eegimaa language, because Essil, of which Bajjat was a district, is the village which has a border with their village. Endungo is the name given by Bayot speakers, but its meaning is not known. K\u00falaakiay, \u2018the language of village of Seleki/S\u00e1llagi\u2019, is the name given by J\u00f3ola Kaasa speakers who are more familiar with the village of Seleki/S\u00e1llagi\u2019 than all other villages of Mof-\u00c1vvi. Finally, Banjal/Bandial \u2018the language of the village of Banjal\u2019, the most popular of all those names, is the name given by the J\u00f3ola B\u00faluf and J\u00f3ola Fogny speakers to Eegimaa people and their language, because people from the village of Banjal were the first to be in contact with them. Figure 1. Map of Senegal (courtesy of Google maps) Figure 2. Map of the Eegimaa speaking area Village names are written using their usual spelling. The Ethnologue language codes are provided for language varieties that have them. Language names are written following the recommendation for the transcription of national languages of Senegal, Decree 2005-981. Names of the villages of Mof-\u00c1vvi are written using the Eegimaa orthography and following the pronunciation of village names by native speakers. J\u00f3ola language varieties which are closely related to Eegimaa include Kujireray/Kuluunaay (from the village of Brin with 76% lexical similarity) and Gufi\u00f1amay (from the village of Afiniam with 74% lexical similarity (based on Lewis et al., 2014 eds.)). G\u00fataamay (from the village of Butam), Gulapaoray (from the village Djilapaor) and Gusiilay (ISO 639-3: bsl) from the village of Thionk Essil are also other languages related to Eegimaa. They are located north of the Casamance River in the J\u00f3ola B\u00faluf area. There are also small migrant Eegimaa communities in villages like Djifanghor (east of Ziguinchor) and in Bourofaye (south of Ziguinchor), where they cohabit with speakers of Ba\u00efnounk languages. Nowadays most Eegimaa speakers from Mof-\u00c1vvi live outside their homeland, generally in urban areas like Ziguinchor and Dakar. Speakers of Eegimaa use the term G\u00fajjolaay (meaning J\u00f3ola) to refer to their language when they speak to each other, but Eegimaa to distinguish their J\u00f3ola variety from that of other J\u00f3ola peoples. Eegimaa is an endangered language whose transmission to new generations has been declining significantly in the last decades. It is important to understand the contact situation of Eegimaa, because some of the ritual names analysed in this paper come from other languages or from neighbouring communities. These names are given either in Eegimaa or in a different language.", "human1": "This section provides details on the Eegimaa languages of Southern Senegal, their speakers and the regions in which they are spoken.", "human2": "This paper presents the location of the G\u00fajjolaay Eegimaa language, a J\u00f3ola language spoken in the Basse Casamance area of Southern Senegal, mainly in Mof-\u00c1vvi, with an estimated population of 7000-11,200 speakers, closely related languages like Kujireray/Kuluunaay and Gufi\u00f1amay, and that speakers often live in urban areas like Ziguinchor and Dakar.", "brio": "In the second part of our series on languages in Senegal, we look at some of the languages spoken in the south of the country.", "simcls": "In this section we discuss the languages of Senegal, and the Jola languages spoken in the country.", "gpt3": "The Eegimaa language is spoken in Mof-\u00c1vvi, a former kingdom of 10 villages located to the west of Ziguinchor, the capital city of the former administrative region of Casamance in the south of Senegal."}, "GUM_bio_dvorak": {"fulltext": "Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Anton\u00edn Leopold Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (/ d(\u0259)\u02c8v\u0254\u02d0r\u0292\u0251\u02d0k, -\u0292\u00e6k / d(\u0259)-VOR-zha(h)k; Czech: [\u02c8anto\u0272i\u02d0n \u02c8l\u025bopolt \u02c8dvor\u031da\u02d0k]; 8 September 1841 \u2013 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer. After Bed\u0159ich Smetana, he was the next Czech Romantic-era composer to achieve worldwide recognition. Following Smetana's nationalist example, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k frequently employed aspects, specifically rhythms, of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's own style has been described as \"the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them\". [1] Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k Dvo\u0159\u00e1k displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was aged 31. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until rediscovered many decades later. In 1874 he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k in 1874 [a] and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the Slavonic Dances, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's international reputation was launched at last. Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. [2] In his career, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. [3] In 1891 Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890 \u2013 91, he wrote his Dumky Trio, one of his most successful chamber music pieces. In 1892, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony From the New World, which spread his reputation worldwide, [4] and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. He also wrote his most appreciated piece of chamber music, the American String Quartet, during this time. But shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895. All of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's nine operas but his first have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is Rusalka. Among his smaller works, the seventh Humoresque and the song \"Songs My Mother Taught Me\" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as \"arguably the most versatile ... composer of his time\".

Early life Otto Jespersen was born in Randers in Jutland. He was inspired by the work of Danish philologist Rasmus Rask as a boy, and with the help of Rask's grammars taught himself some Icelandic, Italian, and Spanish. He entered the University of Copenhagen in 1877 when he was 17, initially studying law but not forgetting his language studies. In 1881 he shifted his focus completely to languages, and in 1887 earned his master's degree in French, with English and Latin as his secondary languages. He supported himself during his studies through part-time work as a schoolteacher and as a shorthand reporter in the Danish parliament. In 1887 \u2013 1888, he traveled to England, Germany and France, meeting linguists like Henry Sweet and Paul Passy and attending lectures at institutions like Oxford University. Following the advice of his mentor Vilhelm Thomsen, he returned to Copenhagen in August 1888 and began work on his doctoral dissertation on the English case system. He successfully defended his dissertation in 1891. Academic life and work Jespersen was a professor of English at the University of Copenhagen from 1893 to 1925, and served as Rector of the university in 1920 \u2013 21. His early work focused primarily on language teaching reform and on phonetics, but he is best known for his later work on syntax and on language development. He advanced the theories of Rank and Nexus in Danish in two papers: Sprogets logik (1913) and De to hovedarter af grammatiske forbindelser (1921). Jespersen in this theory of ranks removes the parts of speech from the syntax, and differentiates between primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries; e.g. in \"well honed phrase,\" \"phrase\" is a primary, this being defined by a secondary, \"honed\", which again is defined by a tertiary \"well\". The term Nexus is applied to sentences, structures similar to sentences and sentences in formation, in which two concepts are expressed in one unit; e.g., it rained, he ran indoors. This term is qualified by a further concept called a junction which represents one idea, expressed by means of two or more elements, whereas a nexus combines two ideas. Junction and nexus proved valuable in bringing the concept of context to the forefront of the attention of the world of linguistics. He was most widely recognized for some of his books. Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin (1922) is considered by many to be his masterpiece. Modern English Grammar on Historical Principles (1909 \u2013 1949), concentrated on morphology and syntax, and Growth and Structure of the English Language (1905) is a comprehensive view of English by someone with another native language, and still in print, over 70 years after his death and more than 100 years after publication. Late in his life he published Analytic Syntax (1937), in which he presents his views on syntactic structure using an idiosyncratic shorthand notation. In The Philosophy of Grammar (1924) he challenged the accepted views of common concepts in Grammar and proposed corrections to the basic definitions of grammatical case, pronoun, object, voice etc., and developed further his notions of Rank and Nexus. In the 21st century this book is still used as one of the basic texts in modern Structural linguistics. Mankind, Nation and Individual: from a linguistic point of view (1925) is one of the pioneering works on Sociolinguistics. Jespersen visited the United States twice: he lectured at the Congress of Arts and Sciences in St. Louis in 1904, and in 1909 \u2013 1910 he visited both the University of California and Columbia University. While in the U.S., he took occasion to study the country's educational system. His autobiography (see below) was published in English translation as recently as 1995. Jespersen was a proponent of phonosemanticism and wrote: \u201cIs there really much more logic in the opposite extreme which denies any kind of sound symbolism (apart from the small class of evident echoisms and \u2018onomatopoeia\u2019) and sees in our words only a collection of accidental and irrational associations of sound and meaning? ... There is no denying that there are words which we feel instinctively to be adequate to express the ideas they stand for.\u201d After his retirement in 1925, Jespersen remained active in the international linguistic community. In addition to continuing to write, he convened and chaired the first International Meeting on Linguistic Research in Geneva in 1930, and acted as president of the Fourth International Congress of Linguists in Copenhagen in 1936. Jespersen was an important figure in the international language movement. He was an early supporter of the Esperanto offshoot Ido and in 1927 published his own project Novial. He also worked with the International Auxiliary Language Association. Jespersen received honorary degrees from Columbia University in New York (1910), St. Andrews University in Scotland (1925), and the Sorbonne in Paris (1927). He was one of the first six international scholars to be elected as honorary members of the Linguistic Society of America.", "human1": "Otto Jespersen was an early 20th Century Danish linguist teaching in Copenhagen, who specialized in the grammar of the English language and authored several influential books such as \"Language: Its Nature, Development and Origin\" (1922).", "human2": "Otto Jespersen was a Danish linguist active between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who focused on the grammar of the English language, and is best known for his work on syntax and language development, including his theories of the Rank and Nexus and his book \u201cLanguage: Its Nature, Development and Origin\u201d.", "brio": "Otto Jespersen was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language.", "simcls": "The work of Otto Jespersen is still considered to be one of the most important contributions to the study of the English language..", "gpt3": "Otto Jespersen was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language."}, "GUM_conversation_lambada": {"fulltext": "Are you \u2014 do they still teach at Bahia on Sunday?

Thin translucent shadows move across her \u2014 the shadows of the neosilk-and-nanotube filaments that hang the city from the hundreds of five-kilometer-high towers that encircle it. (A civic agent notices you noticing, and attaches itself to your infospace, whispering statistics \u2014 \u201cEach object\u2019s suspension must weather a class 5 hurricane and the destruction of 80% of the towers\u201d \u2014 \u201cFrankfurt\u2019s current population is stable at 53 million\u201d \u2014 \u201cAverage age 62, birth rate 0.22, net immigration of half a million a year\u201d \u2014 \u201cCurrent personal squatright: 311 cubic meters per resident\u201d \u2014 until you brush it away.) You\u2019re watching her lean out. The wind whips her hair, ruffles the skirt around her knees. She must be a tourist. You remember your first trip to the upper levels: leaning over the edge into the angry swarm of mites, whirring and buzzing warnings and shoving you back like a million mosquito chaperones. Everyone tries it once \u2014 Except that there aren\u2019t any mites around her. You clutch the railing. Hot, animal fear surges in your chest. She looks up at you and, across the gap of forty meters, smiles a brilliant, heartbreaking smile. Then she lets go and falls. You scream. \u201cFucking airsurfers,\u201d says Derya. He steps off the moving sidewalk near you: tall, hook-nosed, the fashionable whorls of pox and acne making constellations of his cheeks and chest; the glowing, formal tattoos of his committees and lifebrands adorning his massive triceps. You swallow on a dry throat. Derya, of all people, hearing you scream! He gives you a hooded look. \u201cThey infect themselves with some designer virus - it lets them hack the city\u2019s person-recognition systems. So the mites don\u2019t see them when they jump. Watch \u2014\u201d She\u2019s swept past the whalelike oval of the public pool on the 202nd, past the sloping mandala of the Google of offices on the 164th. At the 131st, below her, is the old Stock Exchange, hung upside-down now as a hipster den. Now the mites are finally closing in. A silver swarm coalesces around the 164th, and she vanishes into it, like a snip of scallion into cloudy miso soup. When the cloud disperses, she\u2019s standing on one of the Stock Exchange\u2019s upside-down overhangs. She waves, antlike, then crawls through a dormer window. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d Derya says. \u201cThey\u2019re a huge drain on emergency preparedness. Ripple effects are causing project slowdowns ...\u201d \u201cFreeloaders drive systemic evolution,\u201d you find yourself saying. \u201cDon\u2019t you quote the founders at me,\u201d Derya snaps. \u201cThe Free Society is fragile.

You won\u2019t work, you won\u2019t party, you\u2019ll be defriended by every one of your tribes. Got it?\u201d Her broad-brimmed hat is still sailing on the wind. The mites missed it. It cuts between the towers of the 50th. The upside-down trading floor is deserted. There are heaps of yellowed euros and deutschmarks dumped here, like snowdrifts. Wood panel, marble. Silence. And the air is strangely clear. You realize: no mites. The city has no eyes or ears here. You walk through empty, miteless rooms, stepping around light fixtures. Then she\u2019s there, in a doorway. Her eyes, bright blue, radiant. Her smile, with that chaste yellow dress, so bashful. She comes to you. \u201cYou want it?\u201d she says. \u201cYou want to be infected? You want to fly?\u201d You nod.

It was pretty much the first thing he told us when, as first years, we were all bunched together in the unfamiliar dusty classroom. When, a couple of weeks later we were invited over to his house we saw that this was not an idle remark. Where our bedroom walls were decorated with posters of pop stars and footballers, Steven had diagrams setting out tooth implementations, anatomical drawings of the jaw with brightly coloured nerves, muscle, blood vessels, bones, and, of course, teeth. Where we had shelves of plastic dinosaurs and superhero figurines from cornflake boxes, Steven had plaster casts of jawbones, gums and teeth grinning down at us. The instruments were locked away in glass cabinets and only his parents had the key. \u201cThey don\u2019t exactly encourage my interest,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cThey sort of tolerate it. But Dad says they\u2019re a sort of collection, and too expensive for me to play with.\u201d Of course, we tried to pick the locks, but the spikes and saws and drillheads remained \u2014 tantalisingly \u2014 out of reach. We didn\u2019t see Steven\u2019s interest as strange, well, not that much. We all had our own interests \u2014 drawing, electronics, collecting beer caps \u2014 that each appeared obscure to anyone else. DIY Dentistry was just something that had never crossed our horizon before. And if Steven didn\u2019t see it as weird, or no weirder than Andy showing us his Eastern-Block beer caps all laid out neatly on cork boards with little hand-written labels, why should it bother us? I suppose that, in our own way, we were all collectively strange. The bunch that no one picked for their side at football or hockey, and that was the glue that held us together. Besides, Steven had some really good stuff: sweets that stained your teeth bright red \u2014 well, technically, not your teeth, just the plaque, but the result was often the same. It took a few days good brushing to get it off. Well, most of it anyway. He had effervescent tablets that turned the canteen drinking water into that exact same pink mixture that the dentist gave you to rinse your mouth out after scraping around inside, and guaranteed to make the other kids splutter and spit it out when the taste slowly percolated through and met the memory of their last checkup. Then there was the event that became the rite of passage into our group of misfits and outcasts: making a mould of your teeth. It was inevitable that one of us, seeing the plaster casts on the shelf by Steven\u2019s bed would ask how they were done. It was just as inevitable that a few minutes later, Steven would be mixing up various powders and liquids, and pouring them into a horse-shoe shaped contraption. It wasn\u2019t dangerous. At least, I suppose so. It was vaguely uncomfortable, and appeared sufficiently disturbing that we all volunteered each other in turn until, at last, Andy said he was game. And we were off. The hardest part was probably to overcome the gagging reflex that set in when you bit down into the acrid resin jelly and it flowed out and up and around, over teeth, gums and tongue. Your nose filled with what you imagined were fumes from the warm paste. And you seemed to be suddenly drowning in your own saliva. Things generally got better when Steven reminded you that you could actually breathe, and swallow, normally. He watched the second hand trotting round the dial of his watch mouthing the quarters, before poking the setting goo to check its consistency. Then, when he gave you the nod, you tried to prise your jaws apart. As the seal around your gums and teeth was pretty solid, you thought it would never come off, as the others giggled at your expressions and grimaces. Steven jiggled the handle that stuck out beyond your front teeth like some metallic duck\u2019s bill, turning and twisting it most professionally and murmuring encouragements. And, then, with an awful sucking slurp, it came free. The initiated then revelled in retelling the gross sensation of having this evil-smelling plastic slug invade your mouth, while the others waited their turn with mixed trepidation and excitement. Raucous laughter greeted the suggestions of the other body parts that could receive the same treatment. The next part of the proceedings was less thrilling. Steven measured and mixed the plaster of Paris and prepared for the cast by using a bright blue putty to build up the form of the jaw, and shoring up gaps and holes. It get even less exciting when he said we\u2019d have to wait an hour while the plaster set real solid. But the next time we visited his room we got to marvel at our toothy grins labelled and lined up on the shelf. We were all perfectly happy with the result, even wanting one as a trophy until Steven passed an expert eye over them, pointing out here a gap, here a filling, and there a completely misaligned incisor. We were, he told us, mediocre specimens for his collection. It didn\u2019t matter.

My Presidential qualifications are rooted in my service as an Officer in the United States Air Force. I took the Oath to our Constitution at 22 years old. I understood it was an Oath to ALL of our people. Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters. As President, I will serve ALL of the people in America, guided by the Constitution. Why run for president? Why not run for a lower office that you would be more likely to win and effect change? When I was a young man in Air Force ROTC I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro- NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training. The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy, Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend. I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the \"Top of the Spear.\" In those days it was all or nothing. If you graduated you were assigned a fighter, if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no response to fly another aircraft, you were washed out. Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body. To make a difference in America you must have the \"Bully Pulpit\" and speak to the People. The President has that pulpit. All or nothing. I never wanted to make politics a career. Why did you choose to run in the Republican Party? My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979, when I volunteered for Ronald Reagan and his campaign in New Hampshire. In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties. Today, like many Americans, I am skeptical. I understand third party candidates have no success. I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working class Americans. How do you plan to get into the Republican debates and make an impact on polls? In order to be invited to the debates, we must raise money and poll nationally. This is an effort that is underway. Recently we were listed in New Hampshire and nationally with Politics1. If you do not receive the Republican nomination, would you consider running as a third party candidate? No, I will back the nominee of the Republican party in 2016. After that, I may reconsider. Other than yourself, which candidates have you supported for president in previous campaigns? Reagan in 80 and 84, [George H. W.] Bush in 88 and 92, [Phil] Gramm in 96, [George W.] Bush in 2000 and, Romney in 08. What are your thoughts on the job Barack Obama has done as president? Specifically, what would you have done differently? President Obama has an agenda that represents the far left wing of his party. His use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional. Specifically, altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocs. His direction to Eric Holder to enforce some laws and not others is another example. Hill at the Lesser-known candidates forum in 2011 If elected, what would constitute a successful presidency for you? Achieving four goals: Term Limits for Congress and the Courts returning government to the People. Implementing a Tax System that allows working Americans making under $ 250,000 to keep all of their money. Closing Loopholes and putting in place a system that is transparent and works. Passing a Living Wage program lifting people out of poverty. Returning America to a state of Peace and Security. What individuals would you like to see in a Hill administration? I would like to bring People from the heartland of America that make this nation work. We have had too many decades of Ivy League elites and Professors immersed in theory. Hill (right) with fellow 2012 presidential candidate Buddy Roemer. Anything else you would like to add? A final thought. America is a nation that will endure. I believe it is our responsibility to pass on the same opportunities to future generations that were promised to us.

Sarvis has garnered double digits in opinion polls for the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial election, an unusual feat for a third party candidate. The latest Newsmax / Zogby poll from late September placed him at 13 percent, 14 points behind Republican Party nominee Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia's Attorney General, and 19 points behind Democratic Party nominee Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman, with 24 percent undecided. Whoever wins election on November 5, 2013, would replace outgoing governor Bob McDonnell. On his campaign website, Sarvis notes he favors parental school choice through student vouchers, simplification of Virginia's Tax Code, US Second Amendment - gun - rights, same-sex marriage, and reform of the state's drug laws. With Wikinews, Sarvis discusses his background, views on McDonnell's tenure, keys to campaign success, plan to implement his agenda, and the former Virginia governor he most admires. Interview What is the most important aspect of your background that voters should know about? I am the only candidate born and raised in Virginia, but also the only candidate who embodies both physically and philosophically the growing diversity of the commonwealth. (I am mixed-race (half-Chinese) and in an interracial marriage.) I am the only candidate who has studied both economics and law, and the only candidate with a background in technology entrepreneurship. Because of my academic and professional background, I understand the issues and challenges facing Virginia much better than the other candidates, and I am offering real solutions that can be appreciated across the political spectrum. I am the only candidate who believes in both economic freedom and personal liberty and the only candidate who stands on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law. What are your thoughts on the job Bob McDonnell has done as Governor of Virginia? What would you have done differently than him? McDonnell did well early in his term pushing back against Senate Democrats who wanted huge tax increases in response to major revenue shortfalls during the recession. Those early budget efforts are his highest achievements as Governor. More recently, he erred in accepting a transportation bill that had huge flaws and huge tax increases, rather than prioritizing spending and seeking more rational, efficient, decentralized transportation decision-making. He could have shown much greater leadership in pushing for tax reform, regulatory reform, and school choice. Of course, he showed ethical lapses in judgment. Compared to previous third party candidates at the gubernatorial level, you have done exceptionally well in opinion polling. What do you attribute that success to? Voters see the two-party system for the sham it has become. They are sick of the partisanship and nonsense and the total lack of substance in modern campaigns. Voters see the two major party nominees as exemplifying what is worst about their respective parties, and they want something better. Voters who meet me and hear me speak know that I am sincere, know that I understand the issues deeply and have workable solutions, and know that I stand on principle against cronyism and corporatism and in favor of the rule of law and the public interest. People like the fact that I stand for a Virginia that is both Open-minded and Open for Business. If elected governor, how will you be able to implement your agenda while dealing with a hostile legislature? There are precedents of independent governors dealing effectively with the legislature, and indeed a wise third-party governor can have greater effectiveness than a major party governor. Libertarians share many policy positions with each of the major parties. Working together with both Republicans and Democrats, we can get the good aspects of each party while rejecting the bad parts of both. Moreover, electing a third-party governor represents a repudiation of politics as usual, and the major party legislators will face changed constraints and incentives, meaning that much more is possible than many people assume, especially with strong leadership. Which previous Virginia Governor(s) do you most admire and why? Thomas Jefferson. He was incredibly learned and was a strong advocate for freedom and the rule of law. He would be a Libertarian today.

On April 12, 1981, Space Shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center on STS-1, the first space shuttle mission. NASA held a ceremony commemorating the date outside the hangar, known as Orbiter Processing Facility-1, for Space Shuttle Atlantis, which is being prepped for its final mission which will be STS-135, which will be the last Space Shuttle mission. At the ceremony, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the locations that would be given the three remaining Space Shuttle orbiters following the end of the Space Shuttle program. The prototype orbiter, Space Shuttle Enterprise would be relocated from the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City. Space Shuttle Discovery will take the place of Enterprise at the Udvar-Hazy Center. Discovery has already been retired following the completion of STS-133 last month, its 39th mission. Discovery is undergoing decommissioning and currently being prepped for display by removing toxic materials from the orbiter.

Space Shuttle Challenger was lost when it exploded 73 seconds after liftoff back on January 28, 1986 killing all six aboard. \"We want to thank all of the locations that expressed an interest in one of these national treasures,\" said Bolden to the gathered crowd which contained many KSC employees. \"This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind. In the end, these choices provide the greatest number of people with the best opportunity to share in the history and accomplishments of NASA's remarkable Space Shuttle Program. These facilities we've chosen have a noteworthy legacy of preserving space artifacts and providing outstanding access to U.S. and international visitors.\" This was a very difficult decision, but one that was made with the American public in mind.

Not all were pleased with the final choice of locations. U.S. Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas, issued a statement regarding the rejection of Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas as a location. \"Like many Texans, I am disappointed with NASA's decision to slight the Johnson Space Center as a permanent home for one of the Space Shuttle Orbiters. Houston has played a critical role throughout the life of the space shuttle, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness in the selection of the final locations for the orbiter fleet.\" Cornyn's statement added, \"There is no question Houston should have been selected as a final home for one of the orbiters \u2014 even Administrator Bolden stated as much. Today's announcement is an affront to the thousands of dedicated men and women at Johnson Space Center, the greater Houston community and the State of Texas, and Im deeply disappointed with the Administration's misguided decision.\u201c However, the JSC will recieve pilot and commander seats from the flight deck. The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington was also proposed as another location for a shuttle, going so far as to build a new building to house an orbiter. In a statement, Governor of Washington Chris Gregoire said, \"The Museum of Flight put a tremendous amount of effort into landing a retired shuttle in the Pacific Northwest. As the home of modern day air travel and the 747, which has gracefully transported shuttles for the last 30 years, Seattle would have been a perfect fit. While the Museum of Flight was in the top running, Im disappointed that NASA did not choose them. In 2008, Endeavour and Atlantis await a journey on their respective launchpads.

The 131-page document was found on Castlefrank Road in Kanata, Ontario in a rain-stained, tire-marked brown envelope by a passerby. The document which had the stamp Protected B on every page detailed various security vulnerabilities of the NEMISIS database which is used by officers to track and prosecute environmental law-breakers. If someone were able to shut the system down, or hack inside and delete or corrupt the information, it could affect the prosecution of the lawbreakers. The database was unveiled in 1999 as the National Enforcement Management Information System and Intelligence System. However, on the document, it referred to the database as National Enforcement and Emergency Management Information System and Intelligence System, adding the words \"and Emergency\" to the name. Protection B documents are the second lowest grade of classified government documents. Environment Canada spokesperson Julie Hahn said they apply to letters of complaint, criticism or injury, research or scientific notes and findings that don`t have any conclusion, and Treasury Board letters, agendas and minutes that don`t deal with subjects of national interest. Environment Minister John Baird has asked government officials how such documents that are supposed to be stored in \"approved security cabinets\" wound up on the street. \"I'm told two things: that it's neither classified nor secret and that it's stuff that could be available under access to information,\" Baird said. Environment Canada spokeswoman Sujata Raisinghani told CBC News the department will look into the incident. \"We take document security seriously,\" she said, but refused to give any more details about how the papers came to be on a road. Paul Dewar, an Ottawa New Democrat MP, said the combined security lapses raise serious questions about the government's ability to secure sensitive documents. Dewar says that bureaucrats of the Conservative government have complained to him about document security to the point that they can`t share the information with their own colleagues. However, when a government document has been found on the streets, the government then says it wasn't particularly sensitive. \"This government is so consumed with control of information and secrecy yet they don't seem to be able to get the fundamentals right,\" Dewar said. The incident is a reminiscent of two other incidents. In March, a bundle of blueprints for a new headquarters for the military's counterterrorism unit were found stuffed in the trash on a downtown street. In May, Maxime Bernier was forced to resign as Foreign Affairs minister after it became known that he left sensitive documents at the apartment of his then-girlfriend Julie Couillard who had ties to the Hells Angels biker gang.

I feel like if it were in my power in any way, that kid would have led his parents right through the damned thing. If I were the 'operator' of that site, at the end I would have walked the family through every damn clue the kid noticed and made sure the parents knew the kid was right. They probably won't and he will develop chronic depression. Meirl That would seem to suggest parents aren't all knowing geniuses. Say it a nit so!!

Not to over step my boundaries but ... what cunts. That poor child deserves to be encouraged and listened to. :( This is the flaw with the premise of the movie Idiocracy. My parents always did that when I was a kid whenever there was a problem that needing thinking through they never let me help or dismissed every idea I had simply because I was understandably a kid but you still have to at least let your kids try and help or take their suggestions seriously Thats infuriating because the whole point is to be adventurous and curious OH WAIT I THOUGHT OF ANOTHER ONE So we do proposals. Ring in the final puzzle box, proposal signs, whole package deal, people love it. Dude calls up to set up a proposal, I ask what room he wants etcetera. So then I tell him the total price to book out the entire room for the proposal. He says he just wants to buy the two tickets for him and his girlfriend, I tell him we can't have strangers playing a game that their experience is impacted/altered by the fact that there's a proposal going on. Proposal happens in an Escape Room, there's no longer a game, it becomes about the proposal. I know this because I've seen it happen a hundred times. Anyway, dude refuses to buy out all of the tickets. Says he wants strangers to be there, he's not going to buy the other four tickets. I hand the phone to my manager, they hash out details together. Over the next three weeks leading up to the proposal, this guy calls every. Single. Fucking. Day. There's nothing else to figure out, we've got it all set up, but this guy is constantly badgering us. The big day rolls around, he arrives early so he can hide out, and this dude is a kid. Like, pimple-faced, voice-cracking, hair-growing-in-weird-places kind of kid. Everybody in the control room is talking about him, because he's been a thorn in our collective sides for weeks, and we're speculating about telling him marriage at his age is a horrible idea, but whatever it's too late. So he hides, the girl and her friends show up, they get started and we stash the dude in the second hidden room that they'll eventually end up in. Everybody crowds around the monitor to watch and this guy pulls out a bouquet of flowers and unfurls a sign that says \"NAME REDACTED, will you go with me to PROM?\" And the entire staff loses their collective shit. Weeks of constant pestering, endless phone calls, and the most stressful proposal deal we've ever put together. For a fucking PROMposal.

No one else is stepping up to help solve what should be a civilization-impacting problem. Is it more likely that they are supplying power to only one city, or to an entire world? This is further underlined when dialogue from the second movie only ever refers to Monsters, Inc as the destination for those who want to be scarers (which incidentally, only seem to come from two schools, both of which are also apparently in the city). Also, it is interesting to note that Boo going through the door into the Monster World was said to be \"the first time in Monster History\", and if there were other companies using Door Tech, you would think this would have happened before and there would be protocols for it. The All-Time Scare Record covers only Monsters, Inc, with no indication that there is anyone else at any other companies to compete with. Waternoose mentions that the company has been in his family for \"3 generations\" (Alluding to a possible timeline for energy research in the Monster World, but that's a whole other theory), and he seems unusually attached to it. Most rich people would take advantage of other options and be unconcerned about 1 company. but something in the way he says it (especially since he is not the sole owner, given his concern about the Board of Directors) suggests that there simply are no other options for him. Why wouldn't there be other options for him in a decent-sized world? Monstropolis is the only city ever mentioned. No indication that the supposedly-massive energy crisis is causing problems anywhere else, like in other, less-wealthy countries When trying to get rid of Boo, Mike makes several interesting statements: a. He refers to digging a tunnel under the city b. Using these to release Boo into \"The Wild\" c. And he has previously discarded ideas involving an enormous slingshot and a gigantic wooden horse Why would tunnels be necessary? Why all the planning in the first place? Why not just stuff Boo in the trunk of his car, drive her out of city limits, and set her loose? Because he can't. And what are all these things good at doing? Getting past walls. And walls, especially ones you can't get past, are usually there for a reason. But what reason? We've seen gigantic monsters in both movies, so the most likely reason seems to be that there are things out there that put even these kaiju to shame, or else they could simply march outside and kill whatever is threatening Monster civilization. But even this presents a problem, because then the Monsters could still periodically leave the city like Attack on Titan. Yet Mike's apparent refusal to consider going through any possible gates aside from an ridiculously overkill idea suggests that if any gates do exist, they are tightly sealed against all but the most extreme of circumstances. Why would they be sealed if the Monsters could leave? The simplest explanation for this is that the very environment is hostile to the Monsters. What kind of environment could \"The Wild\" be? A never-ending wasteland like the Glowing Sea? A land that has already mutated some lifeforms into Lovecraftian horrors that stalk the land looking for lesser life to consume? Could this land be related to some event that caused Monster civilization to reject other forms of energy in favor of relatively safe, non-volatile scream energy? What if the world surrounding Monstropolis is the human world? The only thing the monsters seem to be scared of is a human child, believing them to be toxic and deadly. Maybe they found a way to keep their city hidden from humans since they are scared of us and the door system isn't actually taking them to another dimension but somewhere else on the same planet ... That makes more sense, why would monsters be afraid of monsters? They wouldn't ... IF whatever was outside was like them. Which raises the question: what do monsters consider monsters? Humans It seems unlikely, since if that were the case, they could simply talk to the humans who could then work with them to provide any number of energy solutions that don't involve screams. Plus, despite the tech we've seen monsters use, we've never seen them use any cloaking tech (something that would no doubt come in useful for scarers) for something even monster-sized, let alone something that could hide an entire city And don't forget that they talk about the two worlds as if they actually ARE two different worlds. If they were on the same planet, it would make much more sense to talk about borders and being outside the boundaries (Remember, when Mike and Sully are tossed into the Himalayas, Mike's rant about being in the human world implies that they are not merely outside whatever is surrounding Monstropolis)", "human1": "In a discussion about realistic explanations for the film Monsters Inc., one theory points to evidence that Monstropolis is the last city in a destroyed world, while another suggests that the monsters in Monstropolis are afraid of humans, whose world surrounds their city.", "human2": "In an online forum, a user posts a theory arguing that Monstropolis, the fictional city in which the film Monsters, Inc. is set, is the only city remaining in a destroyed world, providing evidence from the film, and while other users suggest that the monster city may just be hidden from an intact human world, the original user responds that this explanation is unlikely.

The humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa, ecological disasters such as Fukushima, political developments like the Arab Spring and terrorist attacks such as the assault on the United Nations building in Abuja last August require concerted action by the United Nations and its Member States. Ten years after 9/11, joint action in the fight against terrorism continues to remain central on the multilateral agenda. In the past nine months, we have witnessed momentous changes in the Arab world that nobody expected when we met one year ago. Pressure for change is driven by the wish of women and men to choose their own fate and to improve their chances for a better life. These are legitimate demands. An overwhelming number of young people were at the forefront of this enormous tide, which started in Tunisia and Egypt. We should pay tribute to their courage. In Libya, thousands lost their lives in the struggle for freedom and democracy. In Syria, and to some extent in Yemen, the suppression is ongoing. Austria strongly condemns the systematic human rights violations and the violence against peaceful demonstrators. We strongly urge those responsible to immediately stop the bloodshed and to engage in meaningful dialogue and reforms. Austria supports the Libyan people in its struggle for freedom. Over \u20ac 150 million blocked in Austrian bank accounts has been de-frozen for humanitarian use. Both the Austrian Government and private sector have provided medicine, relief supplies and desperately needed fuel to Libya. The international community and the United Nations have to support and assist the transition process in the Arab world as the United Nations does now in Libya. This period of change may last for some time and will be full of challenges. Austria welcomes all efforts undertaken by Governments in the region for peaceful and credible change. We encourage the newly empowered authorities to create a constitutional framework based on democracy and human rights, in order to fulfil their mandate for democratic change responsibly and peacefully. The events in the Arab world notwithstanding, we must continue to focus on the Middle East peace process. The Middle East took centre stage this week here at the General Assembly \u2014 and rightly so. We must build trust and we have to foster the belief among Israelis and Palestinians that a negotiated settlement can be achieved \u2014 a sustainable solution based on two States living side by side in a secure and peaceful neighbourhood within mutually recognized borders. We have no choice but to return to direct negotiations between the two parties. The Quartet, in its statement yesterday, has shown a way to do that and has also proposed concrete timelines. Austria fully supports the Quartet statement. There is no time to lose. Austria welcomes President Al-Nasser\u2019s choice of theme for this year\u2019s general debate. We appreciate Qatar\u2019s strong track record in that regard. Last year\u2019s tenth anniversary of the adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, peace and security reminded us that the promise of women\u2019s full and equal participation in all efforts of maintaining peace and security, including in mediation processes, has not yet come true and that we all need to intensify our efforts. In that context, let me also mention an Austrian contribution to international mediation efforts. By inviting political decision-makers from both Khartoum and Juba to Vienna in recent years, Austria has managed to offer the two sides a platform for discussion. We are ready to continue to do so. The Sudan and South Sudan have a shared past and must resolve their remaining problems peacefully. The United Nations headquarters in Vienna serves as a dynamic hub for the promotion of peace, security and sustainable development. I am proud to announce that a liaison office of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs will open in Vienna soon. Over the past year, the International Anti-Corruption Academy set up its headquarters near Vienna, and the Vienna Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation and an office of the International Peace Institute were established. Austria fully stands behind the campaign launched by the Secretary-General on Monday to achieve universal access to modern energy services. We support doubling the rate of improvement in energy efficiency and the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030. Austria provides substantial support to the energy and environment efforts undertaken by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. Last June, we hosted the Vienna Energy Forum, where about 1,400 participants discussed alternative energy concepts to reach the energy goals of the United Nations. The Fukushima nuclear catastrophe should become a turning point in our approach to nuclear safety. We owe it to future generations to make safety concerns come first when using nuclear power. Austria decided, in 1978, to forgo the use of nuclear energy.

On Friday, 28 February, New Zealand recorded its first case of the COVID-19 coronavirus, becoming the 48th country to have a confirmed case. The individual had entered the country two days earlier after spending some weeks in Iran, which is currently experiencing a sizable outbreak of the disease. I can report to the House that they are currently in a stable and improving condition at Auckland Hospital. The good news in this instance is that the individual had limited contact with people upon their return to the country, and their family took all the appropriate measures when presenting at the emergency department. As you would expect, our public health service is working hard to contain this first case and limit the risk of any spread of the disease. Contact tracing began immediately and has gone to plan. All 15 people who were seated nearby the individual on their flight into New Zealand have been traced and are being told to self-isolate. Public health staff will remain in touch with individuals to monitor the situation and give ongoing advice. All but 10 of the remaining passengers on the flight, who are not considered to be close contacts, have also been contacted to provide reassurance and answer any questions they might have; those 10 that haven't been contacted did not provide accurate contact information. I'm advised that as a result of our decisive response, the chance of an outbreak from our first case is low. Internationally, the situation with COVID-19 continues to develop at pace. However, the Director-General of the World Health Organization said, this morning, containment \u2026 is feasible and must remain the top priority for all countries. This is exactly the approach that New Zealand is taking, using three main tools: border controls; self-isolation; and good public health practices, including highlighting the importance of basic hygiene. At every step, the Government has taken decisions in the interests of health and safety of the wider public, and so far we have been among the best at keeping COVID-19 at bay. Just yesterday, Cabinet decided to extend for another week the travel restrictions that have been in place for China since 3 February and for Iran since last Friday. These restrictions have played a key role in keeping COVID-19 out of New Zealand for so long and have given us time to better understand the disease and ramp up our preparations. Of course, members will be aware that there are outbreaks in other regions as well. So, as a further precaution, we have decided that anyone arriving in New Zealand who has been in northern Italy or South Korea who has been there in the last 14 days will be registered for self-isolation. This is based on an expert assessment of risk. It recognises that while there are outbreaks in both countries, they also have well-developed health systems and the outbreaks are largely located in specific regions. We know self-isolation works. It is a longstanding and successful approach to managing infectious diseases and has proven its worth again in recent weeks. We have also stepped up the health presence at our airports. All airlines flying into New Zealand have been requested to read a health message upon landing, and all arrivals into New Zealand will receive health information cards alongside the standard customs declaration form. As a result of decisions taken on Friday, health staff are meeting all direct international flights landing in New Zealand airports from Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Thailand. Our border response is further ramping up to have health staff available for all international flights into New Zealand. All these decisions and actions are designed to limit the spread of any sporadic COVID-19 cases that might arrive in New Zealand. At the same time, our health system continues its preparations in line with our comprehensive pandemic plan. I want to thank our DHBs, public health staff, and primary care and health officials for the work they are doing to protect the public. I have high confidence in our medical professionals.

In the fifth century BC, Leucippus and Democritus argued that all matter was composed of small, finite particles that they called atomos, a term derived from the Greek word for \u201cindivisible.\u201d They thought of atoms as moving particles that differed in shape and size, and which could join together. Later, Aristotle and others came to the conclusion that matter consisted of various combinations of the four \u201celements\u201d \u2014fire, earth, air, and water\u2014and could be infinitely divided. Interestingly, these philosophers thought about atoms and \u201celements\u201d as philosophical concepts, but apparently never considered performing experiments to test their ideas. The Aristotelian view of the composition of matter held sway for over two thousand years, until English schoolteacher John Dalton helped to revolutionize chemistry with his hypothesis that the behavior of matter could be explained using an atomic theory. First published in 1807, many of Dalton\u2019s hypotheses about the microscopic features of matter are still valid in modern atomic theory. Here are the postulates of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory. 1. Matter is composed of exceedingly small particles called atoms. An atom is the smallest unit of an element that can participate in a chemical change. 2. An element consists of only one type of atom, which has a mass that is characteristic of the element and is the same for all atoms of that element (Figure 2.2). A macroscopic sample of an element contains an incredibly large number of atoms, all of which have identical chemical properties. Figure 2.2 A pre-1982 copper penny (left) contains approximately 3 \u00d7\u00d7 1022 copper atoms (several dozen are represented as brown spheres at the right), each of which has the same chemical properties. (credit: modification of work by \u201cslgckgc\u201d / Flickr) 3. Atoms of one element differ in properties from atoms of all other elements. 4. A compound consists of atoms of two or more elements combined in a small, whole-number ratio. In a given compound, the numbers of atoms of each of its elements are always present in the same ratio (Figure 2.3). Figure 2.3 Copper(II) oxide, a powdery, black compound, results from the combination of two types of atoms\u2014copper (brown spheres) and oxygen (red spheres)\u2014in a 1:1 ratio. (credit: modification of work by \u201cChemicalinterest\u201d/Wikimedia Commons) 5. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are instead rearranged to yield substances that are different from those present before the change (Figure 2.4). Figure 2.4 When the elements copper (a shiny, red-brown solid, shown here as brown spheres) and oxygen (a clear and colorless gas, shown here as red spheres) react, their atoms rearrange to form a compound containing copper and oxygen (a powdery, black solid). (credit copper: modification of work by http://images-of-elements.com/copper.php) Dalton\u2019s atomic theory provides a microscopic explanation of the many macroscopic properties of matter that you\u2019ve learned about. For example, if an element such as copper consists of only one kind of atom, then it cannot be broken down into simpler substances, that is, into substances composed of fewer types of atoms. And if atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, then the total mass of matter present when matter changes from one type to another will remain constant (the law of conservation of matter). EXAMPLE 2.1 Testing Dalton\u2019s Atomic Theory In the following drawing, the green spheres represent atoms of a certain element. The purple spheres represent atoms of another element. If the spheres touch, they are part of a single unit of a compound. Does the following chemical change represented by these symbols violate any of the ideas of Dalton\u2019s atomic theory? If so, which one? Solution The starting materials consist of two green spheres and two purple spheres. The products consist of only one green sphere and one purple sphere. This violates Dalton\u2019s postulate that atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change, but are merely redistributed. (In this case, atoms appear to have been destroyed.)

The government had overseen the construction of new railroad lines and for the first time used standardized rail tracks that allowed the North to move men and materials with greater ease. The North\u2019s economy had shifted to a wartime model. The Confederacy also mobilized, perhaps to a greater degree than the Union, its efforts to secure independence and maintain slavery. Yet the Confederacy experienced ever - greater hardships after years of war. Without the population of the North, it faced a shortage of manpower. The lack of industry, compared to the North, undercut the ability to sustain and wage war. Rampant inflation as well as food shortages in the South lowered morale. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH EUROPE From the beginning of the war, the Confederacy placed great hope in being recognized and supported by Great Britain and France. European intervention in the conflict remained a strong possibility, but when it did occur, it was not in a way anticipated by either the Confederacy or the Union. Napoleon III of France believed the Civil War presented an opportunity for him to restore a French empire in the Americas. With the United States preoccupied, the time seemed ripe for action. Napoleon\u2019s target was Mexico, and in 1861, a large French fleet took Veracruz. The French then moved to capture Mexico City, but the advance came to an end when Mexican forces defeated the French in 1862. Despite this setback, France eventually did conquer Mexico, establishing a regime that lasted until 1867. Rather than coming to the aid of the Confederacy, France used the Civil War to provide a pretext for efforts to reestablish its former eighteenth - century colonial holdings. Still, the Confederacy had great confidence that it would find an ally in Great Britain despite the antislavery sentiment there. Southerners hoped Britain\u2019s dependence on cotton for its textile mills would keep the country on their side. The fact that the British proved willing to build and sell ironclad ships intended to smash through the Union naval blockade further raised Southern hopes. The Confederacy purchased two of these armored blockade runners, the CSS Florida and the CSS Alabama. Both were destroyed during the war. The Confederacy\u2019s staunch commitment to slavery eventually worked against British recognition and support, since Great Britain had abolished slavery in 1833. The 1863 Emancipation Proclamation ended any doubts the British had about the goals of the Union cause. In the aftermath of the proclamation, many in Great Britain cheered for a Union victory. Ultimately, Great Britain, like France, disappointed the Confederacy\u2019s hope of an alliance, leaving the outnumbered and out - resourced states that had left the Union to fend for themselves. AFRICAN AMERICAN SOLDIERS At the beginning of the war, in 1861 and 1862, Union forces had used contrabands, or escaped enslaved people, for manual labor. The Emancipation Proclamation, however, led to the enrollment of African American men as Union soldiers. Huge numbers of formerly enslaved as well as free Black people from the North enlisted, and by the end of the war in 1865, their numbers had swelled to over 190,000. Racism among White people in the Union army ran deep, however, fueling the belief that Black soldiers could never be effective or trustworthy. The Union also feared for the fate of captured Black soldiers. Although many Black soldiers saw combat duty, these factors affected the types of tasks assigned to them. Many Black regiments were limited to hauling supplies, serving as cooks, digging trenches, and doing other types of labor, rather than serving on the battlefield (Figure 15.16). Figure 15.16 This 1865 daguerreotype illustrates three of the Union\u2019s distinct advantages: African American soldiers, a stream of cannons and supplies, and an extensive railroad grid. (credit: Library of Congress) African American soldiers also received lower wages than their White counterparts: ten dollars per month, with three dollars deducted for clothing. White soldiers, in contrast, received thirteen dollars monthly, with no deductions. Abolitionists and their Republican supporters in Congress worked to correct this discriminatory practice, and in 1864, Black soldiers began to receive the same pay as White soldiers plus retroactive pay to 1863 (Figure 15.17). Figure 15.17 African American and White soldiers of the Union army pose together in this photograph, although in reality, Black soldiers were often kept separate and given only menial jobs. For their part, African American soldiers welcomed the opportunity to prove themselves. Some 85 percent were formerly enslaved people who were fighting for the liberation of all of the enslaved and the end of slavery. When given the opportunity to serve, many Black regiments did so heroically. One such regiment, the Fifty-Fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers, distinguished itself at Fort Wagner in South Carolina by fighting valiantly against an entrenched Confederate position. They willingly gave their lives for the cause. The Confederacy, not surprisingly, showed no mercy to African American troops. In April 1864, Southern forces attempted to take Fort Pillow in Tennessee from the Union forces that had captured it in 1862. Confederate troops under Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest, the future founder of the Ku Klux Klan, quickly overran the fort, and the Union defenders surrendered. Instead of taking the African American soldiers prisoner, as they did the White soldiers, the Confederates executed them.

Honestly, if I was redoing this from the beginning, I would have really liked to have a double bed in this room, but, unfortunately, with the space as you can probably see from that wall there till the door, it's basically just enough to fit a bed and a couch, and this is my couch over here. I've recently changed it, and if you've been following my channel for a long time, then you'll know I'm really proud of how I color match the pictures on the wall over here with sort of the gray and yellow vibe, the gray and yellow cushions. This couch is also quite big, it fits three people quite comfortably, and if I have family or friends staying over, it opens up into a full double bed. This coffee table over here, it's glass and has two levels, so it's really good when we have multiple friends over, and we have lots of food to put on the table, or if we're playing board games, we can have people sit around it, and still have a lot of space to lay everything out. So there's nothing too special about the bed itself, but it does have a very important function, which, it has a lot of storage. So down here is basically where I keep everything that I can't really keep in my room, because there's not enough space. I've got an ironing board, all of my suitcases, socks, clothes that I don't wear that often, anything that I need for fixing the house like screwdrivers, drills, nails, all these things that I definitely wouldn't want to have laid out in my room, but I still need somewhere in the house. I love that this room has floor-to-ceiling windows as well, it really lets the light come in, especially in the summer time. I know London doesn't have that much light, but I'll take as much as I can, and there's also a small balcony out here, which is fairly rare for London. We have two chairs where we can sit down and sort of enjoy the weather when it is a little bit better, um but now it's really cold so just gonna close it. And then a little behind the scenes that you probably will never see again in a video is that down here I keep all of the filming gear that doesn't really fit anywhere else in the room: two sets of tripods, I also have a c-stand. Okay next to my bed, I've got the radio alarm clock, and this has actually changed my life. It makes waking up in the morning and getting out of bed at 6:00 a.m. when it's pitch black outside so much easier when you're waking up really early. It's so much better to wake up to the sound of somebody talking to you: your favorite radio station, some music, whatever, instead of that classic iPhone alarm, \"ba, ba, ba.\" Over here on the wall, these are posters that I actually bought back in 2013 in my first year of university in Toronto, and I really really liked them so I've kept them around.

Welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new. Today I'm doing another college day in my life. And I just left Starbucks, don't mind what I look like. I literally just pretty much woke up and left this morning. I'm starting the review for all the chapters for my final exam, and it is a lot of information so I already planned on getting up early today and going. And then I'm gonna do the same thing tomorrow. I basically like created a digital calendar where I'm gonna go over each of the chapters, just because I only have one week left to study. I'm back home now, and I basically just typed up a little calendar laying out the chapters that I have left to review before Tuesday. That's my final list and I hate that, like, this week is our Thanksgiving break and then we literally come back Tuesday and take our final. So I'm gonna be studying on Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and the whole weekend even though we're going getting our Christmas tree I think on Saturday, and I I'm not decorating I'm not doing anything fun, like I have to study. I thought I would show you guys kind of how I'm mapping this out, because it's a really good tip if you have like a lot to do. So today I'm doing female reproductive system, male reproductive system tomorrow. I work on Wednesday, I'm going to go over chapter 29 fluid balance, chapter 28 so urinary system on the 29th. The 30th, Chapters 17 through 22 - yes that's like six chapters or something. And then on Sunday, I'll be doing chapters 23 through 27 and I just made this on my iPad and then printed it. I did not include my schedule for college algebra because I have a final on Thursday of next week for that. So I'm going to go in with like a different color and add in the chapters I'm gonna be studying for that, but I'm super stressed. I bought these Vans from DSW. They are really cute. You guys know I have the white ones and I wear them all the time and these ones are just like black perforated Vans. I love them and they are definitely the right size because I have two other pairs of Vans that are this size, but one of these ones is like messed up or something. I think it's like this part on the left foot because my foot feels super tight in only the left side, so something's up because they're both the right size but I don't know. So I'm gonna exchange them for another pair because something's not right about that. Hey guys. So I just got finished at the library. I just sat in there for like an hour and a half straight and studied. I'm really proud of myself and now I'm about to go get some lunch, and go to DSW and see if I can exchange those Vans. So while I was in the library one of you guys came up to me, and said hi. I feel so bad because I was so in the zone that I didn't even get her name. But if you're watching this, hi thank you so much for coming and saying hi to me you actually made my whole day. She said she watches my videos and loves them. And you guys are so sweet, I love making videos and it's so nice to have that support. So if you do go to FGCU and you ever see me on campus, like feel free to say hi because you'll make my day. I just got out of DSW, and I spent like 30 minutes in there because it was just such a process for them to do an exchange. And then she had to scan and go get the shoes and then she said they didn't have the size. So I ended up having to order them, but she said there was no way to do a direct exchange. So she had to give me a return and then re-ring it up. And oh my gosh I was literally in there for like 25 minutes all to just do a simple exchange for the exact same shoe. But it's over now and they're gonna send them to me in the mail. Hopefully they'll be here in about a week. I'm just kind of sad that they didn't have them in stock, so now I have to wait.

Often overshadowed by San Francisco, its larger neighbor lying directly to the west, Oakland has in recent years began to step out from under the shadows, playing upon the beautiful highlights of its own and its rise as the multicultural \"hipster' city of the Bay Area. Since the 1960s, Oakland has been a hub of radical culture, and is the birthplace of both the Black Panther Party and the Hell's Angels. Oakland's history in the arts and entertainment arena is notable as well, as Oakland has nurtured or been a second home to novelists Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Amy Tan, and Maya Angelou; actors Meryl Streep, Mark Hamill, Bruce Lee, and Tom Hanks; architect Julia \"Butterfly\" Hill; classical conductor Calvin Simmons; rappers MC Hammer, 2Pac, Messy Marv, and several other notables in the liberal arts and sciences. Oakland as a city reflects the amazing diversity of its residents and long history. For many visitors, the first place they are likely to visit is Downtown, especially if they are in town on business, or simply do not know where to start. The center of transportation by BART and by bus is there, if one wants to branch out. And it is as simple as walking in a direction from there, for the first few neighborhoods, since Old Oakland is along 10th Street, just west of Broadway. Just east of Broadway and continuing north and south is Oakland's famous Chinatown, and that to get the real essence of \"Chinatown,\" Oakland rather than San Francisco is your best bet. Many of the buildings and streets of Chinatown reflect the diverse nature of its history, in architecture and in the bilingual signs seen throughout the neighborhood. The curious traveler can venture to take a bus southwards along Broadway, and come to Jack London Square. The unlikely mixture of warehouses and very expensive restaurants and posh atmosphere alongside some of the landmarks of the city's waterfront makes the Square an interesting place to visit and explore, even for locals. It's the home of the USS Potomac and the site of the namesake author's residence, still preserved and humbly standing not far from a saloon from the same era. Just west of Downtown and slightly north of the Financial District is Uptown. In the evening it buzzes with art galleries, theaters and residents and Bay Area visitors coming into the area to see concerts. A popular area on the weekend with a mixed vibe of hipster and hip hop. It's a burgeoning neighborhood of performing arts ranging from nightclubs to music halls, avant-garde performance art, and even an improv theater company. Uptown also has some of the best in the city's vintage architecture, like the Gothic Revival Cathedral Building and the Art Deco Fox and Paramount Theaters, as well as several restaurants. North Oakland is a sweeping term, referring to just about everywhere north of Uptown and Lake Merritt. Many of the neighborhoods are commercial centers and absolute heaven for foodies or those who seek quieter surroundings than the hustle and bustle of Downtown and Chinatown. Temescal is a neighborhood that lies north-northwest from Downtown, centered along the reach of Telegraph Avenue, at and near 51st Street. Until the 1960s, a dominantly Italian-American neighborhood, it is now a much more diversified neighborhood, home to many restaurants, including some of the city's best Korean and Ethiopian establishments. Northeast of Temescal and near the Berkeley border lies Rockridge, a neighborhood mixed with family friendly and artistic vibes. It has lots of local boutiques and a diverse range of food at all prices and styles. Open-air markets, bookstores, and a BART station all its own make Rockridge another of many pleasant stops in North Oakland. South of Rockridge, and southeast of Temescal lies Piedmont Avenue, a street extending from Broadway near 34th and Hawthorne and an area with a group of hospitals on a hill (Pill Hill) up and through a neighborhood bordered on both sides by picturesque hills, houses and trees. Another of North Oakland's group of foodie spots, home to the city's single Michelin-rated restaurant and many others; cafes, ice cream, coffee shops and pleasant walks complete the vision of this interesting and quiet neighborhood. East along I-580 and not far from Piedmont Avenue are two neighborhoods separated by a couple of blocks. Grand Lake and Lakeshore both share a friendly, suburban sort of feel. The Grand Lake Theater stands at the entrance to the neighborhood that bears its name, a matter of a few hundred feet from Lakeshore Avenue \u2013 both are diverse neighborhoods no matter what your budget, be it burgers or sandwiches or a full romantic evening, either of these twin-sister neighborhoods will make a pleasant time, by day or night. West Oakland was once a burgeoning working-class neighborhood with its roots tracing as far back as the opening decades of the 19th century. It has seen a period of decline between the 1960s and the more recent past. Strangely, twice in its history the neighborhood has seen benefits from major earthquakes. After the 1906 earthquake, many San Franciscans relocated there, and the industrial development of the 20s and 30s saw its population in the hundreds of thousands. With Loma Prieta in 1989, the effective barrier of the Cypress Street Overpass was destroyed, and the decades since have seen the rebuilding and refurbishing of many of the neighborhood's original Victorian houses, and there is a burgeoning performing arts community growing near the center of the neighborhood. Though there are a few draws for the traveler, West Oakland is dominantly a very poor working-class residential neighborhood with a less than spectacular reputation.", "human1": "This guide to Oakland describes the city's history since the 1960s and its neighborhoods, including Downtown and its skyline, Chinatown's architecture and bilingual signs, Uptown with its art galleries, theaters and night clubs, North Oakland's commercial centers, foodie heavens, Temescal and Rockridge, and working-class West Oakland.", "human2": "The guide describes Oakland, a radical culture hub and multicultural \"hipster\" city neighboring San Francisco in the Bay Area, including its following neighborhoods and some notable landmarks: Downtown, Old Oakland, Chinatown, Jack London Square, USS Potomac, Financial District/Uptown, North Oakland, Temescal, Rockridge, Piedmont Avenue, Grand Lake, Lakeshore, and West Oakland.", "brio": "The city of Oakland, in the East Bay region of California, is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States.", "simcls": "Oakland, California is a city of contrasts.", "gpt3": "Oakland is a diverse city with many different neighborhoods, each with its own unique history and character."}, "GUM_voyage_vavau": {"fulltext": "Vava\u2019u is a group of more than 50 islands in Tonga, about 150 miles north of Tongatapu.

Growing Beavertail can be done at any time of year by scattering seeds in a shady bed or, for faster results, planting cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring that they have a bit of water and plenty of sun. Read the following steps to find out how to grow Beavertail cactus. Method 1 of 2: From Seeds Purchase Beavertail cactus seeds. These can be bought at garden centers or purchased online. Scatter the seeds. In a shady garden bed, simply scatter the seeds on the soil. There's no need to cover them, unless you want to use netting to keep the birds off. Keep the soil moist until the seeds germinate. Make sure that the garden bed is in the shade. Beavertail cacti seeds need shade to grow, whereas cuttings need plenty of direct sunlight. Be aware that growing Beavertail cactus from seeds takes much longer than growing one from a cutting. It can take as long as 4 to 4 years before you get flowers. Method 2 of 2: From Cuttings Obtain Beavertail cuttings. You can purchase them online or at a local garden center. If you already own a Beavertail cactus, you can make your own cuttings. To do this, choose pads (the flat, oval-shaped sections that make up a cactus) that are 6 months old or older and cut them at the base. In order to form a callous and prevent rot, cure the cuttings by sitting the pad upright in a dry, dark place for 10 to 14 days. Plant the cuttings. Prepare a potting mix that is equal parts soil and rough pumice or sand and fill the appropriate number of pots with it. Make sure there are holes in the center of the base of each pot to allow for good drainage. Set the cuttings upright in the potting mix about an inch (2.5 cm.) deep. If you plant the cuttings too deep, they might rot. Put some rocks around the pad to anchor it in place. Choose a spot for your Beavertail cactus cuttings. If you live in an area with strong summer sun, position the cuttings so that the broad sides of the cuttings face east and west while the slim sides face north and south. This will prevent the cuttings from burning during the hottest part of the day. Make sure the spot is sheltered from any cold winter winds. Wait for a month. Do not water the cutting for the first month. The moisture in the pad will provide enough nutrients for roots to grow. Too much water might cause rot. After 1 month, roots will have sprouted and you can water the cutting for the first time. Always let the soil dry before you water the cuttings. Once fully rooted, they are extremely drought resistant. Fertilize the plants. During the spring, summer, and fall, the Beavertail cactus grows and will benefit from a balanced fertilizer. Let the cuttings grow. From the first pad, many more will form. The second or third pad will bear some flowers, but wait before harvesting them or you might affect the size of future harvests.", "human1": "This guide explains how to grow Beavertail cactus, either from seeds in a shady garden in moist soil, leading to flowers in 4 years, or more quickly from cuttings, 6 months or older, cured in dry shade for 10-14 days, then planted upright in pots with drainage holes in the sun, watering after a month and letting soil dry, as well as fertilizing in spring, summer and fall.", "human2": "Using detailed instructions of two growth methods, this article describes how Beavertail Cacus can grow either by scattering purchased seeds in a shady garden bed and waiting 4 years, or by planting Beavertail cuttings in a mix of soil and sand and ensuring there is plenty of sunlight to grow quicker compared to planting seeds", "brio": "The Beavertail cactus is a desert plant that can be grown from seeds or cuttings.", "simcls": "Beavertail cactus is a fast-growing, annual plant that can be grown from seeds or cuttings..,", "gpt3": "To grow Beavertail cactus, either scatter seeds in a shady garden bed or plant cuttings in a sunny spot."}, "GUM_whow_mice": {"fulltext": "How to Get Rid of Mice Naturally Having mice in your home is both a nuisance and a health hazard. They can cause property damage, create a mess, and produce unpleasant smells. In addition, repelling and removing rodents from your home can be a hassle if you don't know what you are doing. It can also be dangerous if you use toxic chemicals and poisons. It's a good thing, then, that there are some simple ways to effectively get mice out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons. Method 1 Discouraging Mice Naturally Keep your home clean. Many times mice are drawn into homes on the search for food. If there is nothing to eat, mice will be less likely to stay. Keep all food stored properly in airtight containers or in places that are safe from mouse attack. [1] Apply peppermint oil. Peppermint oil is a natural deterrent. The smell is simply too intense for rodents and they will not try to go near it. It also helps to mask the scent of any tasty morsels that have been missed when cleaning. It also gives the house a lovely smell, and is not toxic, unlike many synthetic chemical treatments. You can get peppermint oil in most health food stores and even some major grocery stores. [2] Place a drop or two on a cotton ball. Place a cotton ball under or near your garbage can to deter mice from getting into it. Place the cotton balls in areas where mice are likely to enter your house, by doorways, or heat vents, etc. Peppermint oil cotton balls need to be replaced after 5 - 7 days, depending upon the quantity of oil you put on it. Try growing peppermint plants near the entryways. You can use the mint in cooking, as well as it serving a deterrent purpose. Use dried snake feces. Visit a local reptile center, zoo, or pet store and ask for some dried snake poo. You can also sometimes find someone who owns a pet snake. Place near entrances and in places where mice seem to go. This will keep mice away. [3] Be sure to keep the feces out of the reach of children and pets. Zap mice with ultrasonic sounds. There are electronic units sold that emit an ultrasonic beeping sound that rodents hate. They should be available at your local home improvement store or online. These work only on a single line of sight, so you need to know the exact path the mice are taking. The units may only work for a short time because mice can become used to them. [4] Use a commercial, organic deterrent. Many companies that specialize in organic garden and home products make mice repellents that are better for the environment than traditional poisons. Many of these products use natural ingredients, such as peppermint, that are known to be disagreeable to mice. They will not kill mice but they should keep them out of areas where the product is applied. These products should be available at your local gardening or home improvement center. If you want a specific product, try doing a online search to see where it is available locally. Get a cat. A house cat can take care of the problem. Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to hunt to find their own food and may track down that mouse. Just be aware, not all cats have enough energy, interest or training to hunt mice. Kittens typically have to be taught by the mother to easily become a mouser. Well-food indoor kitties might just see the mouse as a toy, and grow quickly bored of it after scaring it half witless. Shelters and adoption agencies often do not know if a cat is a good mouse hunter, and generally do not test for this. Sometimes this information is available, but usually not. While many mousers are great pets as well, not all are. \"Barn cats\" may not be socialized well with humans, although used to hunting mice for food. Even if you do not have a cat, you can use used kitty litter to deter mice. Place tubs of used kitty litter around entrances of the house. The mice will sniff the smell of cat urine and clear off in a jiffy. If you have a large infestation, a cat may not be enough to totally get rid of it. However, once you eliminate the infestation, a cat will probably prevent reinfestation. [5] Put your trash cans far from your home. Mice smell garbage and get attracted to your house. If you keep the cans away from the house, they are less likely to take up residence in your home. Promote the nesting of birds of prey in your yard. Build a shelter box in your garden to attract some onto your property. This may take some time, but it's worth the effort if you can attract a wild mouse eater to your yard. [6] Make sure the shelter box has no nails or safety hazards. A barn owl is the best. A family of barn owls can eat many mice in a night! However, you might attract other types of owls or birds of prey with your nesting box.", "human1": "This guide to getting rid of mice at home naturally suggests keeping your home clean, storing food in airtight containers, applying peppermint oil on cotton balls near your garbage and doors or growing peppermint, using snake feces or ultrasonic beeping devices, or getting a cat or attracting birds of prey to your yard using a shelter box.", "human2": "This guide explains how to get rid of mice without chemical products, and recommends keeping food stored away, placing peppermint oil-infused cotton balls in the house, or dried snake feces, getting a good-mouser cat, using devices to emit ultrasounds or organic deterrents, moving the trash cans away from the home, and attracting birds of prey in the garden with a nesting box.", "brio": "If you are having problems with mice in your home, here are some simple ways to effectively get them out of your home without the use of toxic chemicals and poisons.", "simcls": "Mice are a problem that many homeowners are unable to get rid of..", "gpt3": "The text discusses various methods of getting rid of mice naturally, including keeping the home clean, using peppermint oil, growing peppermint plants, using snake feces, and using ultrasonic sound devices."}}
